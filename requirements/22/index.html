    <p>This document outlines the requirements that the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (WCAG WG) has
      set for the development of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2. These requirements build on the
      existing requirements for WCAG 2.0, and are designed to work in harmony with the WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1 standards.
    </p>

  <section id="introduction">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG 2.0)</a> [[WCAG20]]
      explains how to make Web content accessible to people with disabilities. Since the release of WCAG 2.0 in December
      2008 and the release of WCAG 2.1 in June 2018, these standards have been widely adopted and implemented. As a
      result of feedback from implementers, ongoing changes in technologies, and responding to the need for regular
      updates in accessibility content standards, the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (AGWG) is pursuing the
      development of WCAG 2.2.</p>
    <p>The underlying goal of WCAG 2.2 requirements are the same as for WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1 â€“ to promote accessibility
      of Web content. WCAG 2.2 must satisfy additional requirements addressed in this document including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Web pages which conform to WCAG 2.2 conform to WCAG 2.1 (which conforms to WCAG 2.0).</li>
      <li>WCAG 2.2 success criteria continue support additional use-cases.</li>
      <li>WCAG 2.2 success criteria are in harmony and address the needs of users in multiple domains where possible.
      </li>
      <li>Utilize the WCAG 2.0 conformance model.</li>
      <li>Utilize the WCAG 2.0 A/AA/AAA model.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2-req/">Requirements for WCAG 2.0</a> [[wcag2-req]] provides details used
      during the development of WCAG 2.0, including key goals related to technology independence, clearly defined
      conformance requirements, and more which are still relevant and important. As with WCAG 2.0, work on each
      specifications in the same line (WCAG 2.x) will provide techniques and supporting documentation to assist in
      implementation efforts, and any criteria modified or introduced by a WCAG 2.x release will need to be verifiable
      by implementers.</p>
    <p>WCAG 2.x specifications are expected to offer modifications to existing success criteria as well as
      offer additional guidelines and success criteria but WCAG 2.x requirements may not weaken what is required
      generally of web content to be considered conformant to either. The result of this is that when a page conforms to
      WCAG 2.x it will also conform to to the previous versions.</p>

    <p>In any WCAG 2.x specification - an existing success criteria may change in priority from a lower level to a
      higher level, but not the other way around. Criteria can be changed or removed so long as accessibility issues caught by the original success criteria remain issues in the updated guidelines.</p>
    <p>For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A Level A Success Criteria cannot move to Level AA.</li>
      <li>Existing success criteria may be modified or removed in a WCAG 2.x release, but the resulting change must
        retain functional backwards compatibility with previous versions. That is, accessibility requirements in WCAG 2.0 will
        still be covered by WCAG 2.x.</li>
      <li>An existing success criterion could be removed if accessibility support makes it redundant.</li>
      <li>An existing success criterion could be removed if the accessibility requirement is covered by other (new or
        old) success criteria.</li>
      <li>New WCAG 2.x success criteria should not conflict with each other, allowing authors to address additional
        requirements for more than one user group.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Group members working on different success criteria should maintain good communication about work in progress
      with the main Working Group and across Task Forces to minimize conflicts/duplication of work wherever possible.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>WCAG 2.2 success criteria continue support for additional use-cases from WCAG 2.1</h2>
    <p>WCAG 2.2 will build on WCAG 2.1 and provide additional criteria to address the accessibility of content for
      use-cases that were a focus of WCAG 2.1. Improvements in support for users of small or touch-screen devices, as
      well as for low-vision users and users with cognitive, language, and learning impairments.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Utilize the WCAG 2.0 conformance model.</h2>
    <p>The WCAG 2.0 Requirements document provides details about conformance that needs to be met for WCAG 2.x releases.
      However WCAG 2.x releases need to provide conformance details that indicate the conformance relationship between
      them, and existing WCAG 2.0 conformance. WCAG 2.2 must specify that conformance claims indicate that a page
      conforms to WCAG 2.1 as a base. Future WCAG 2.x specifications must conform to its immediate previous ancestor
      specification as a base. </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Utilize the WCAG 2.0 A/AA/AAA model.</h2>
    <p>WCAG 2.2 will utilize the WCAG 2.0 A/AA/AAA structure. Additional or changed success criteria will specify at
      what Level those criteria are provided. When a page conforms to WCAG 2.2 at a specific level, that page must
      conform to WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1 at the same level or higher.</p>
    <p>It is important to note that changes in WCAG 2.2 to the level for any existing WCAG 2.x success criteria need to
      be made with awareness of the implementability and testability requirements for the new level. For WCAG 2.x
      releases to ensure backwards compatibility level changes must be clear for the immediate previous ancestor
      specification as a base.</p>
    <p>For example, a success criteria may currently be at Level AAA as a result of very limited testability, and moving
      that success criteria to Level AA in WCAG 2.2 or a WCAG 2.x would require greater testability. In order to
      successfully make this transition there must be evidence that testability is more robust. </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Example </h2>
    <p>Some new success criteria and guidelines in WCAG 2.2 are created that effectively make some changes (strengthen)
      previous WCAG 2.0 conformance requirements, and a page that conformed to WCAG 2.0 is tested against WCAG 2.2:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>One new WCAG 2.2 success criteria modifies (strengthens) an existing AA success criteria (e.g. 1.4.3 Color
        Contrast [minimum]) and in effect, moves it to level A.</li>
      <li>Adds a new guideline and two other new success criteria - 5.1 at level A and 5.2 at level AA.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A web page that previously conforms to WCAG 2.0 AA is reviewed against the new WCAG 2.2 specification. In the
      review, it is determined that the page still meets 1.4.3, which is now a level A criteria, and the page also meets
      5.1 (level A), but it does not meet the new 5.2 (level AA).</p>
    <p>As a result, the page could claim to conform to the new WCAG 2.2 success criterion for 1.4.3 Color Contrast
      [minimum] at level A, and the new 5.1 success criterion (level A), but not the new 5.2 (level AA).</p>
    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong>The author may choose to change their claim or not, as it will be possible to conform to
      WCAG 2.2 success criteria without making an explicit conformance claim.</p>
    <p>Note that most of these terms are further discussed in the <a
        href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2-req/">Requirements for WCAG 2.0</a> [[wcag2-req]]
