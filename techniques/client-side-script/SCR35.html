      <p>Script used with HTML or XHTML.</p>
   </section><section class="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The objective of this technique is to demonstrate how to invoke a scripting function in a way that is keyboard accessible by attaching it to a keyboard-accessible control. In order to ensure that scripted actions can be invoked from the keyboard, they are associated with "natively actionable" HTML elements (links and buttons). The onclick event of these elements is device independent. While "onclick" sounds like it is tied to the mouse, the onclick event is actually mapped to the default action of a link or button. The default action occurs when the user clicks the element with a mouse, but it also occurs when the user focuses the element and hits enter or space, and when the element is triggered via the accessibility API.</p>
      <p>This technique relies on client-side scripting. However, it is beneficial to provide a backup implementation or explanation for environments in which scripting is not available.  When using anchor elements to invoke a JavaScript action, a backup implementation or explanation is provided via the href attribute. When using buttons, it is provided via a form post. </p>

      <section class="example">
         <section class="description"><h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Link that runs a script and has no fallback for non-scripted browsers. This approach should only be used when script is relied upon as an Accessibility Supported Technology.</p>
            <p>Even though we do not want to navigate from this link, we must use the href attribute on the a element in order to make this a true link and get the proper eventing. In this case, we're using "#" as the link target, but you could use anything. This link will never be navigated.</p>
            <p>The "return false;" at the end of the doStuff() event handling function tells the browser not to navigate to the URI. Without it, the page would refresh after the script ran. </p>
         </section>
         <pre xml:space="preserve">
&lt;script&gt; 
function doStuff()
 {
  //do stuff
    return false;
  }
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;a href="#" onclick="return doStuff();"&gt;do stuff&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>
      </section>
      <section class="example">
         <section class="description"><h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Link that runs script, but navigates to another page when script is not available. This approach can be used to create sites that don't rely on script, if and only if the navigation target provides the same functionality as the script. This example is identical to the example 1, except that its href is now set to a real page, dostuff.htm. Dostuff.htm must provide the same functionality as the script.The "return false;" at the end of the doStuff() event handling function tells the browser not to navigate to the URI. Without it, the browser would navigate to dostuff.htm after the script ran.</p>
