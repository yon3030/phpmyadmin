			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p class="instructions">Describe how the technique works. This begins with a description of the problem the technique solves, then describes how to apply the technique. The description should be detailed enough to provide all the information a reader needs to be able to apply the technique, without recourse to following example code.</p>
			<p>The objective of this technique is to help people who use speech input to operate web content to reliably activate controls, and at the same time prevent users  from unwillingly activating controls.</p>
			<p>When used to interact with a web page, speech users usually say a command followed by the name of a label (like a button or a link) such as "click search". the speech recognition software can the match the text it has understood to the name of a control to apply the command (such as activating an input of type=submit with the value "search"). The problem this technuique addresses is that the name of a control used for this matching (th eso-called "accessible name") is not necessarily the visible label. For example, the button follwing a search input field may contain the text "go" but use an invisible aria-label attribute with the value "search". Since aria-label takes precedence over the text included in the button, the accessible name of this button is search, not go. (Compare the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/accname/">Accessible Name and Description Computation</a> algorithm).</p>

			<h2>Examples</h2>
			<p class="instructions">Copy the following section for each example. Examples must have a title and a description, and usually have a code sample. Code samples should be elided if necessary to show the core of the technique without necessarily providing all the surrounding code that would also be involved. A working example link references a location where the technique can be shown working live.</p>
