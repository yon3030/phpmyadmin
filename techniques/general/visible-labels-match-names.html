			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>The objective of this technique is to help people who use speech input to operate web content reliably. The secondary objective is to prevent speech users from accidentally activating controls.</p>
			<p>When speech users interact with a web page,, they usually speak a command followed by the name of a label (like a button or a link), for example, "click search". The speech recognition software can then process the text it has understood and apply the command to the control (such as activating an input of type=submit with the value "search").</p>
			<p>The problem addressed by this technique is that the name of a control that speech recognition sodtware used for this matching (the so-called "accessible name") is not necessarily identical to the visible label. For example, a  button follwing a search input field may contain the text "go" but use an invisible aria-label attribute with the value "search". Since aria-label takes precedence over the text included in the button, the accessible name of this button is "search", not "go". (Compare the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/accname/">Accessible Name and Description Computation</a> algorithm).</p>

			<h2>Examples</h2>
			<p class="instructions">Copy the following section for each example. Examples must have a title and a description, and usually have a code sample. Code samples should be elided if necessary to show the core of the technique without necessarily providing all the surrounding code that would also be involved. A working example link references a location where the technique can be shown working live.</p>
