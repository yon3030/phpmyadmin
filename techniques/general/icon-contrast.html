			<h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to ensure graphics such as icons provide enough contrast for people with vision impairments. Not all graphics are within the scope of <a href="../../understanding/21/non-text-contrast.html">SC 1.4.11 Non-text contrast</a> but if it is required to understand the content, then it should have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1.</p>
            <p>The success criteria for non-text contrast uses the term <a href="../../understanding/21/non-text-contrast.html#graphical-objects">&quot;graphical object&quot;</a> to cover small simple graphics, and parts of larger complex graphics. This technique focuses on solid color icons used on solid or gradient backgrounds.</p>
            <p>When choosing the colors for graphics consider the color(s) adjacent to that graphic, and test that the contrast ratio is at least 3:1.</p>
            <p class="note">A selection of tools and applications for testing contrast ratios can be found in <a href="../../understanding/20/contrast-minimum.html#resources">Understanding SC 1.4.3 Contrast (minimum)</a>.</p>

			<h2>Examples</h2>
			<section class="example">
				<h3>Solid icon color against the background</h3>
				<p>A solid icon such as a telephone symbol uses orange on a white background. The colour orange (<code>#E3660E</code>) is tested against the white background (<code>#FFFFFF</code>) and it has a contrast ratio of 3.4:1.</p>
				<p><img alt="Orange icon on white background" src="img/contrast-phone-icon.png"></p>
            </section>
            <section class="example">
				<h3>Solid icon color against a custom background</h3>
				<p>A solid icon such as a telephone symbol used within an orange background. The orange and white colour are the same as example 1, in this case the contrast against the white background is not relevant, the white icon within the orange background is what needs to meet the contrast.</p>
				<p><img alt="Orange icon on white background" src="../../understanding/21/img/contrast-phone.png" width="100"></p>
            </section>
            <section class="example">
				<h3>Solid icon with a gradient background</h3>
				<p>A solid icon such as a telephone symbol using a dark blue icon on a white-to-blue gradient background. The first test of the icon should be against the darkest (least contrasting) background that is adjacent to the icon color. If that is at least 3:1, it passes the success criteria.</p>
				<p><img alt="Dark blue icon on white-to-blue background." src="img/contrast-phone-icon-gradient.png"></p>
            </section>
            <section class="example">
				<h3>Solid icon with gradient background overlapping in contrast</h3>
                <p>A solid icon on a gradient background can overlap in contrast if the graphic is still understandable where it does not have contrast against all of the background. If you find the part of the gradient where it does not meet a 3:1 ratio with the graphic and assume people cannot perceive that part, does the icon still indicate the meaning?</p>
                <p>A method of visualizing this is to remove the non-contrasting area and check that you can still understand the icon. If so, it is sufficient. The images below shows an icon on a gradient background, and a second version where it removes the area of the icon  that does not meet the 3:1 contrast ratio.</p>
				<p><img alt="Dark blue icon on white-to-blue background that is dark at the bottom." src="img/contrast-phone-icon-gradient2.png"> <img alt="Dark blue icon on white-to-blue background." src="img/contrast-phone-icon-gradient3.png"></p>

            <h2>Tests</h2>
            <p>The tests assume the use of a color contrast tool with a color-picker interface to detect particular colors.</p>
			<section class="test-procedure">
                <h3>Procedure</h3>
                <p>For each graphical object required for understanding:</p>
				<ol>
                    <li>Select the foreground color of the graphical object.</li>
                    <li>Select the adjacent background color. If the background color is a gradient or pattern, select the color with the least contrast to the foreground color.</li>
                    <li>Check that the contrast ratio is equal to or greater than 3:1.</li>
                    <li>If part of the background area does not meet 3:1 with the foreground, assume that the part of the icon adjacent to that area is not visible.</li>
                    <li>Check that the icon is still recognizable without any area of in-sufficient contrast.</li>
				</ol>
