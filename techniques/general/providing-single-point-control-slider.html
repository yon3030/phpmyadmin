			<h2>When to use</h2>
			<h3>Applicability</h3>
			<p>Any technology that supports pointer input (e.g. supporting any or all of the following: mouse pointer, touch on touch screen or trackpad, stylus input, or laser pointer input).</p>
		</section>
		<section id="description">
			<h2>Description</h2>		
			<p>The objective of this technique is to ensure that users who have difficulties performing path-based gestures can operate a control slider with a single pointer (e.g., a single tap on a touch screen or a single mouseclick). A control slider allows users to set a value in a certain range, e.g. setting the volume, changing the hue value of a color, putting in the amount of money needed in a loan calculator, or picking a sum to be donated to a charity. Swiping left or right across the slider or dragging the thumb of the slider to the left or the right can change the value dynamically.</p>
        <p>A simple fallback for single point activation is to make the control slider groove clickable. This way, a value can be specified using single point activation over the groove.</p>
     <p>Providing controls (for example, arrow buttons) as alternative means of input allows incrementing otr decrementing the value  with single pointer input. This allows for a more fine-grained setting of the value.</p>

			<p class="note">This technique addresses gestures where support has been implemented by authors, not gestures provided by the user agent (such as horizontal swiping to move through the browser history or vertical swiping to scroll through page content) or the operating system (e.g., gestures to move between open apps, or call up contextual menus of assistive technologies when these are enabled).</p>			
      <p class="note">On touch screen devices, author-supplied path-based gestures usually do not work when OS level assistive technologies (AT) like a built-in screenreader are turned on. This is because AT generally consumes path-based gestures so they would not reach the authored content. When custom controls are built on top of native controls, however, these may also be operable with AT gestures such as vertical swiping to change the value (see example 1).</p>

			<h2>Example 1</h2>
			<p>A custom control slider built on top of a native slider (input type range) allows users to swipe left and right or drag the slider thumb to change the value of the slider. The sider groove allows single point activation: tapping or clicking it will set the slider thumb to the activated position.</li>

	<h2>Tests</h2>
		<section class="test-procedure">
		<h3>Procedure</h3>
		<p>For control sliders that respond to path-based gestures:</p>
		<ol>
    		<li>Check that the value of the control slider (range) can be set with single point activation. There may be dedicated buttons to increase / decrease the value in a stepwies fashion, or the slider grove may resond to single point activation, moving the thumb to the position activated.</li>
