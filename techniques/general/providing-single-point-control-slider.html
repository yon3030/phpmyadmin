			<h2>When to use</h2>
			<h3>Applicability</h3>
			<p>Any technology that supports pointer input (e.g. supporting any or all of the following: mouse pointer, touch on touch screen or trackpad, stylus input, or laser pointer input).</p>
		</section>
		<section id="description">
			<h2>Description</h2>		
			<p>The objective of this technique is to provide simple single-click/touch activation alternatives for any functionality offered through more dynamic gestures. Such simple activation involves no requirement for movement after pointer engagement (i.e., after the down-event). This ensures that users who have difficulties performing any form of dragging can still operate all pointer-activated page functions.</p>

		<p>Operations involving dragging, from operating slider controls to free-form drag-and-drop, rely on a user being able to maintain a consistent depressed pointer state while also manipulating the pointer. Users may be significantly challenged in carrying out dragging due to tremors, limitations in dexterity, or technology shortcomings. Offering a means of interaction which does not rely on dragging ensures more users can successfully interact with a page in more circumstances.</p>

			<p>Note: Excluded from scope for this technique are alternatives for the cancellation action achieved by a user when moving the pointer from the target area after a down-event has been initiated. This form of cancellation is well-established and the intent of this technique is not to force an alternative method of cancellation, although other methods for Undo may be feasible in many circumstances.</p> 
		
      		<p class="note">On touch screen devices, author-supplied dragging gestures usually do not work when OS level assistive technologies (AT) like a built-in screenreader are turned on. This is because AT generally consumes gestures, resulting in them  not reaching the authored content. When custom controls are built on top of native controls, however, these may also be operable with AT gestures such as vertical swiping to change the value (see example 1).</p>

			<h2>Example 1</h2>
			<p>A custom control slider built on top of a native slider (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/range">input type range</a>) allows users to drag the slider thumb to change the value of the slider. As an alternative, the slider track allows tapping or clicking to set the slider thumb to the activated position. Standard buttons on either side allow for more precisely incrementing and decrementing the slider value.</p>
