			<h2>When to Use</h2>
			<p>Use this technique on web pages that detect device or user motion such as shaking or tilting and use this motion as a means of input.  If the motion itself is essential to the application's function, then this technique does not apply.</p>
			<p>This technique also does not relate to movement of users through space as registered by geolocation sensors or beacons, or events observed by the device other than intentional gesturing by the user. It also does not cover indirect motion associated with operating a keyboard, pointer, or assistive technology.</p>

			<h2>Description</h2>
	
			<p>The objective of this technique is to ensure:
			<ol><li>People who use mounted devices or who cannot precisely manipulate a device are able to provide inputs through more conventional user interface components, and</li>
			<li>People who may accidentally activate sensors due to tremors or other motor impairments have the ability to turn off motion actuation to prevent such accidental triggering of functions.</li></ol>
			</p>
			<p>In this technique, when a device sensor such as accelerometers or gyroscope is used to gather input:
			<ol><li>A button, link, or other conventional control is provided that does not rely on sensor input, and</li>
			    <li>A setting is provided to allow the user to turn off the sensor data.</li></ol>			
			</p>

			<h2>Examples</h2>
			<section class="example">
				<h3>Input Fields</h3>
				<p>After text is input in a field, shaking a device shows a dialog offering users to undo the input. Supporting use of the backspace key and/or providing a clear button next to the text field offers the same functionality.</p>
				<p>Shake to undo can be turned off at the operating system.</p>

				<h3>Motion Activated Slider</h3>
			<h2>Tests</h2>
			<section class="test-procedure">
				<h3>Procedure</h3>
				<p>For each input that performs a function in response to a motion sensor: </p>
				<ol>
					<li>Check that there is a mechanism to perform the same function that does not rely on a sensor.</li>
					<li>Check that there is a user setting which disables the motion detection.</li>
				</ol>
