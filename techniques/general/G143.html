   </section><section class="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The purpose of this technique is to provide information via the text alternative that identifies the non-text content as a
            CAPTCHA. Such tests often involve asking the user to type in text that is presented in an obscured image or audio file. From the text alternative, the user can tell that the CAPTCHA requires completing a task and what type of task it is.</p>
      <p>When an alternate version of a CAPTCHA is available, the text alternative should include instructions about how to find the alternate version.</p>
