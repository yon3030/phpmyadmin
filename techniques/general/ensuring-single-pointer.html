			<h2>When to use</h2>
			<h3>Applicability</h3>
			<p>Any technology that supports pointer input (e.g. supporting any or all of the following: mouse pointer, touch on touch screen or trackpad, stylus input, or laser pointer input).</p>

			<h2>Description</h2>		
			<p>The objective of this technique is to ensure that users who have difficulties performing path-based or multi-point gestures can operate content with single pointer. This technique may involve either not using path-based or multi-point gestures to operate content, or providing alternative controls for pointer input that can be operated by a single pointer (e.g. a tap or tap-and-hold on a touch screen, or a click or long press with a mouse or other indirect pointing device).</p>

			<p>On touch screen devices, author-supplied path-based and multipoint gestures usually do not work when OS level assistive technologies (AT) like a built-in screenreader are turned on. AT generally consumes a path-based or multipoint gestures so they would not reach the authored content. For example, a horizontal swipe gesture may not reveal a menu as intended by the author, but move the screen reader focus to the next or previous element. Some gestures may work if the user operates "pass-through gestures" which are often unreliable as they may depend on factors of hardware, operating system, operating system "skin", operating system setting, or user agent. </p>

			<p class="note"> This technique addresses gestures where support has been implemented by authors, not gestures provided by the user agent (such as horizontal swiping to move through the browser history or vertical swiping to scroll through page content) or the operating system (e.g., gestures to move between open apps, or call up contextual menus of assistive technologies when these are enabled). </p>

			<h2>Examples</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>A carousel component allows users to swipe left and right to reveal adjeactent carousel slides. There are also next and previous buttons that enable users to move the next or previous carousel slides.</li>
				<li>A swipe-left gesture over an element opens up options related to that element (file, delete). The element can also be activated with a single click / tap to open a view where these options appear as well.</li>
				<li>A web site includes a map view that supports the multi-point (two finger) pinch gesture for zooming in. User interface controls offer the zoom operation via [+] and [-] buttons.</li>

		<h3>Procedure</h3>
		<p>For any content that responds to path-based or multi-point pointer gestures:</p>
		<ol>
    		<li>Check that all functionality that can be activated via path-based or multi-point pointer gestures can also be operated also with a single pointer.</li>
