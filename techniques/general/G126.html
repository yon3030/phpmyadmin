      <p>The objective of this technique is to provide a list of links to all the Web pages in the set on each Web page. It is one of a series of techniques for locating content that are sufficient for addressing Success Criterion 2.4.5. 
            This technique is only effective for small sets of Web pages; if the list of links is longer than the rest of the content in the Web page, it may make the Web page more difficult for users to understand and use.</p>
      <div class="note">
         <p>Success Criterion 2.4.1 requires a technique for skipping this list of links.</p>
