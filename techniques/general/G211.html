			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p >The objective of this technique is to ensure that users who attempt to interact with a control do not trigger the action of the event accidentally. This can be accomplished most directly by relying on the “pointer up” event. This allows users interacting with touch screens to utilize the screen as support to stabilize the activation target. Another approach would be to activate on the “pointer down” event, but if the “pointer up” event occurs outside of the control, to immediately undo the action.</p>
      <p>The easiest way to meet this success criteria is simply to use the default behavior of controls. The up-event is the default behaviour for almost all controls and any programming or markup language.  An Editable Text box could have the cursor enter the editable area on the “pointer down” event, because the action is trivially reversible, any text is easy to delete. However, a Submit button would need to either provide a confirmation dialogue or have its event occur on the “pointer up” event. A key on a keyboard application could respond on the “pointer down” event because such behavior would be considered essential for that control.

			<h2>Tests</h2>
			<p class="instructions">Tests must have a test procedure and expected results. Populate the following sections as appropriate. If a technique has multiple alternative testing approaches, add a new section with class="test" for each one, and put the test-procedure and test-results sections inside that.</p>
			<section class="test-procedure">
				<h3>Procedure</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Find all clickable controls with actions that are irreversible. If this is the case:</li>
<li> Check if the action is triggers on the up event </li>
<li> Check if the action triggers a confirmation dialogue</li>
<li> Check if the nature of the action relies on being triggered on the “pointer down” event.</li>
				</ol>
			</section>
			<section class="test-results">
				<h3>Expected Results</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>#1 or #2 or #3 are true. </li>
