			<h2>When to Use</h2>
			<p >This technique applies to nearly all technologies.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="description">
			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p >The objective of this technique is to ensure that users who attempt to interact with a control do not trigger the action of the event accidentally. This can be accomplished most directly by relying on the “pointer up” event.  </p>
      <p>The easiest way to meet this success criteria is simply to use the default behavior of controls and not override that behaviour with an explicit down-event trigger. The up-event is the default behaviour for almost all controls and any programming or markup language.  </p>
     <p>In native languages where a control is fired on the down event it is usually for good reason and is easily recoverable. For instance, an HTML input element could have the cursor enter the editable area on the “pointer down” event, because the action is trivially reversible, and as such meets the requirements of the Pointer Cancellataion SC. </p>

				<h3>Using an generic button or link in HTML</h3>
        <p>In HTML use a native <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;a href ....&gt;</code>.</p>

			<h2>Tests</h2>
				<section class="test-procedure">
				<h3>Procedure</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Find all clickable controls with actions that are irreversible. If this is the case:</li>
<li> Check if the action is triggers on the up event </li>
<li> Check if the nature of the action relies on being triggered on the “pointer down” event.</li>
				</ol>
