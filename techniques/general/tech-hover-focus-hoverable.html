			<h2>When to Use</h2>
      <p>The Technique is applicable to any technology that supports the display of additional content on pointer hover.</p>

			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>Content that is displayed in a popup when users move the pointer over a trigger or focus the trigger with the keboard needs to stay visible and remain permanent until dismissal when users move their pointer over the popup content. Low vision users using screen magnification often see only a small part of the screen. This means that the popup content may not be fully visible in the currently visible section. Often, the position of content visible in the enlarged section changes based on users' mouse movement, so magnification users may move their mouse over partly visible popup content to read it. Web content should therefore ensue that popup content stays vsisible when the pointer moves away from the trigger to (mostly adjacent) popup content. Popup content should also be dismissable without moving the focus so that users can read content covered by the popup.</p>

			<section class="example">
				<h3>Content preview popup when keyboard-focusing or hovering over links</h3>
				<p>When focusing a link in an online encyclodedia, a popup with a content preview appears just above or below the link. The user can move the pointer over the popup to move the enlarged section so they can fully read the popup content. Pressing the Escape key will dismiss (close) the popup content.</p>
				<code>Code sample</code>
        <pre><code>&lt;a href="..." onfocus="openTooltip(...)" onmouseover="openTooltip(...)" onblur="closeTooltip(...)" onmouseout="closeTooltip(...)" onkeyup="if (event.key == 23) { closeTooltip(...); event.preventDefault();">Foo</a></code></pre>
