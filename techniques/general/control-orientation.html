			<p>When authors lock the orientation of the page, provide a control to allow a user to change the orientation.</p>
		</section>

			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>The objective of this technique is to allow users to override author orientation decisions and view content as they prefer. Authors may design content for a preferred orientation and expect that people will use this orientation when viewing their content, or the author may decide that a user wants to maintain the orientation with which they initiated viewing. As a result the author may prevent the content from rotating. However, this fails the Orientation Success Criterion, since the author has restricted the view and operation to one orientation.</p>
			<p>By providing a prominent mechanism to allow the user to rotate restricted content, the author meets the Orientation requirement. For example, a person who cannot hold a device and has it mounted to a wheelchair or bed will be able to re-orient the content to match their display's physical orientation.</p>
      <p class="note">Many users will expect to use OS-level settings to preserve a desired orientation. As a result, instead of restricting orientation at the content level, and then allowing a user to override that restriction, it is usually best to satisfy this Success Criterion by allowing users to enable	 the OS orientation lock when desired.</p>

			<h2>Examples</h2>
			<section class="example">
				<h3>A portrait-only e-Reader application with a rotate button</h3>
        <p>Users of an e-Reader web application sometimes read when laying down on their side. In this situation, the device is viewed by the user in portrait mode even though the device is in the landscape orientation with regard to gravity. The author locks the content into the portrait orientation to allow for this reading behavior; however, the author also provides a Rotate button to allow users who have devices mounted in a landscape orientation to achieve this desired view.</p>

			<h2>Tests</h2>
			<section class="test-procedure">
				<h3>Procedure</h3>
        <p>For content that does not change orientation when the device is rotated:</p>
        <ol>
					<li>Check for a control within the user interface to change the orientation of the content.</li>
          <li>Check that when the control is activated, the content changes orientation.</li>
				</ol>

			<section class="test-results">
				<h3>Expected Results</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Checks #1 and #2 are true.</li>
