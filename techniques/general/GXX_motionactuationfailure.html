		<section id="applicability">
			<h2>Applicability</h2>
			<p>Use this technique on web pages that detect device or user motion (such as shaking or tilting) and use these motions as a means of input.</p>
			<p>This technique does not relate to movement of users through space as registered by geolocation sensors or beacons, or events observed by the device other than intentional gesturing by the user. It also does not cover indirect motion associated with operating a keyboard, pointer, or assistive technology. </p>
      <p>This technique relates to Success Criterion 2.5.4: Motion Actuation (Failure).</p>
		</section>
		<section id="description">
			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>This describes the failure condition that results when motion actuation cannot be deactivated.  People who may accidentally activate sensors due to tremors or other motor impairments need the ability to turn off motion actuation to prevent such accidental triggering of functions.  </p>

			<h2>Examples</h2>
	
			<section class="example">
				<h3>Motion-Activated Slider</h3>
				<p>A slider can be activated by tilting the device right to increase the value and left to decrease the value. It also offers "Decrease value" and "Increase value" buttons to each side of the slider so that a user can adjust the value without using motion actuation. However, there is no way for users to prevent the interface from responsing to user motion.</p>

			<h2>Tests</h2>
			<section class="test-procedure">
				<h3>Procedure</h3>
				<p>For each input that performs a function in response to a detected motion event:
				<ol>
					<li>Check that there is a user setting which disables the motion detection.<li>
				</ol>
			</section>
			<section class="test-results">
				<h3>Expected Results</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>If #1 is false then the control fails this success criteria. </li>
				</ul>
