			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>Some authors provide shortcuts in their applications to allow for faster user interaction. However, where such shortcuts involve only character keys (letters, numbers, punctuation or symbol characters) without modifiers, they create challenges for speech input users as well as some keyboard users who lack the ability to type accurately.</p>
			<p>To prevent accidental activation, authors must allow users to turn off or reconfigure shortcuts that are made up of only character keys. Providing a mechanism to perform one or both of these actions ensures more users can successfully interact with the application.</p>
			<p class="note">If the keyboard shortcut is only active when a particular user interface component has focus, then the author does not need to provide an override mechanism. For example, in a <code>select</code> element, it is expected behaviour that pressing a letter key will reposition to the next item within the select element that begins with that character. This shortcut is only triggered when the select element has focus, and so it does not interfere with a user's ability to interact with the rest of the page.</p>

			<h2>Examples</h2>
			<section class="example">
				<h3>Author provides a simple mechanism to disable shortcuts in a web-based email client</h3>
				<p>An email client contains single-character shortcut keys so that keyboard users can more rapidly interact with the application (e.g., the R key replies to the current item in the inbox, the D key deletes it, the S key stars it). These keys do not apply while users are composing emails; however, users may become confused about whether the keyboard focus is in a compose pane or the inbox, and inadvertently delete a message if typing a word containing the letter D. The author provides a toggle button for the shortcuts, so that users can easily toggle them off or on.</p>

			<section class="example">
				<h3>Author provides a menu option where users can remap shortcuts</h3>
				<p>A web-based application has single character key shortcuts for functions which are different than those a user regularly uses with a software application installed locally. The author provides a menu where the user can reassign the shortcuts to be used in combination with a modifier key such as Ctrl.</p>

				<ol>
					<li>Determine if the user has the ability either to turn off the shortcut or to remap it to a combination that includes one or more modifier keys.</li>
