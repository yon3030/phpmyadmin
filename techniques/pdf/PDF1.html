      <p>Tagged PDF documents with images</p>
   </section><section class="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The objective of this technique is to provide text alternatives for
    				images via an /Alt entry in the property list for a Tag. This is normally
    				accomplished using a tool for authoring PDF. </p>
      <p>PDF documents may be enhanced by providing alternative descriptions
    				for images, formulas, and other items that do not translate naturally
    				into text. In fact, such text alternatives are required for accessibility:
    				alternate descriptions are human-readable text that can be vocalized
    				by text-to-speech technology for the benefit of users with vision disabilities. </p>
      <p>When an image contains words that are important to understanding the
    				content, the text alternative should include those words. This will
    				allow the alternative to accurately represent the image. Note that
    				it does not necessarily describe the visual characteristics of the
    				image itself but must convey the same meaning as the image. </p>

         <h3>Example 5: Adding a text alternative to an image in a PDF document
    				using an /Alt entry</h3>
         <section class="description"><h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The /Alt property used on an image of mountains with a moon and trees
    						typically would be used like this (typically accomplished by an authoring
    						tool): </p>
            <pre xml:space="preserve">/Figure &lt;&lt;/Alt (Sketch of Mountains with moon rising over trees) &gt;&gt;</pre>
            <p>The image might also be represented by a tag with a different name.
    						A different name might be used because the tag name is written in
    						a language other than English or because a specific tool uses a different
    						name for some other reason. In this situation, it is also necessary
    						that the RoleMap contained within the StructTreeRoot for the PDF
    						document contain an entry which explicitly maps the name of the tag
    						used for the image with the standard structure type used in PDF documents
    						(in this case, Figure). If the RoleMap contains only an entry mapping
    						Shape tags to Figure tags, the rolemap information would appear as
    						follows: </p>
            <pre xml:space="preserve">/RoleMap &lt;&lt; /Shape /Figure &gt;&gt;</pre>
            <p>In this case, the usage of the /Alt entry as follows would also
    					be correct: </p>
            <pre xml:space="preserve">/Shape &lt;&lt;/Alt (Crater Lake in the summer, with the blue sky, clouds and crater walls perfectly reflected in the lake) &gt;&gt;
    					</pre>
            <p>Note that the /Alt entry in property lists can be combined with
    						other entries. </p>

      <section class="procedure"><h3>Procedure</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>
               <p> Verify the images which need equivalents have /Alt entries on
    					an enclosing tag by one of the following:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li> Read the PDF document with a screen reader, listening to hear
	    						that the equivalent text is read when tabbing to the non-text
	    						object (if it is tabbable) or hearing the alternative text read
	    						when reading the content line-by-line. </li>
                  <li> Using a PDF editor, check that a text alternative is displayed for each
	    							image. </li>
                  <li> Use a tool which is capable of showing the /Alt entry value,
	    								such as aDesigner, to open the PDF document and view the GUI
	    								summary to read the text alternatives for images. </li>
                  <li> Use a tool that exposes the document through the accessibility
	    						API and verify that images have required text equivalents. </li>
               </ul>
