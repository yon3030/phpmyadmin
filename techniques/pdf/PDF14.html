   </section><section class="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The objective of this technique is to help users locate themselves
    				in a document by providing running headers and footers via pagination
    				artifacts. This is normally accomplished using a tool for authoring
    				PDF. </p>
      <p>Running headers and footers help make content easier to use and understandable
    				by providing repeated information in a consistent and predictable way.
    				The content of headers and footers will vary widely depending on the
    				document scope and content, the audience, and design decisions. Some
    				examples of location information that may be used in headers and footers
    				are listed below. Whether the information appears in a header or a
    				footer is often a design decision; page numbers often appear in footers
    				but they may alternatively appear in headers. </p>
      <ul>
         <li> Document title </li>
         <li> Current chapter and/or section in the document</li>
         <li> Page numbers with location information such as, "Page 3-4" or "Page
    				9 of 15." </li>
         <li> Author and/or date information. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Consistency helps users with cognitive limitations, screen-reader
    				users and low-vision magnifier users, and users with intellectual disabilities
    				understand content more readily. </p>
      <p>The easiest way to provide page headers and footers is in the authoring
    				tool for the document. Authoring tools typically provide features for
    				creating header and footer text and information (such as page numbers).
    				However, if after converting your document to PDF, you need to add
    				or modify page headers and footers, authoring or repair tools like Adobe Acrobat Pro's Header &amp; Footer
    				tools can be used. In all cases, the tools generate page headers and
    				footers in consistent and predictable layout, format, and text. </p>

         <h3>Example 4: Marking a running header or footer as a pagination artifact
    				in a PDF document using an /Artifact tag or property list</h3>
         <section class="description"><h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The PDF specification allows running headers and footers to be marked
    						as "pagination artifacts" as defined in section 14.8.2.2 "Real
    						Content and Artifacts," of <a href="http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/pdf/pdfs/PDF32000_2008.pdf">PDF
    							1.7 (ISO 32000-1)</a>. </p>
            <p>An artifact is explicitly distinguished from real content by enclosing
    					it in a marked-content sequence with the /Artifact tag. </p>
            <pre xml:space="preserve">/Artifact
BMC
...
EMC
</pre>
            <p>or</p>
            <pre xml:space="preserve">/Artifact propertyList
BDC
...
EMC
</pre>
            <p>The first is used to identify a generic artifact; the second is
    						used for artifacts that have an associated property list. Note: to
    						aid in text reflow, artifacts should be defined with property lists
    						whenever possible. Artifacts lacking a specified bounding box are
    						likely to be discarded during reflow. </p>
            <p>Property list entries for artifacts include Type, BBox, Attached,
    						and Subtype. </p>
