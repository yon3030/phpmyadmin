      <p>Tagged PDF documents with interactive form fields. </p>
   </section><section class="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The objective of this technique is to ensure that assistive technologies
    				can gather information about and interact with form controls in PDF
    				content. </p>
      <p>The types of PDF form controls are: text input field, check box, radio
    				button, combo box, list box, and button. </p>
      <p>Providing name, role, state, and value information for all form components
    				enables compatibility with assistive technology, such as screen readers,
    				screen magnifiers, and speech recognition software used by people with
    				disabilities. </p>
      <p>The PDF specification defines how name, role, and value are set for
    				form controls in Section 12.7.4 (Field Types) of <a href="http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/pdf/pdfs/PDF32000_2008.pdf">PDF
    					1.7 (ISO 32000-1)</a>, as shown in the following table. The Comments column explains how Adobe Acrobat Pro displays the corresponding information. </p>
      
         
            
               Interactive Form Dictionary Entries
               Used to Define
               Comments
            
            
               FT
               Role
               Controls that share field type also use field flags to set
    				the appropriate role. In Adobe Acrobat the role for form controls
    				is set automatically.
            
            
               TU
               Name
               In Adobe Acrobat the TU entry value is provided via the Tooltip
    					field in the form control's Properties dialog. This should
    					not be confused with the T entry which is defined as the Name
    					in Acrobat's form control properties dialog - the name field
    					in the Properties dialog is not used to provide the name for
    					a control when read by assistive technologies.
            
            
               CA
               Name (Pushbuttons only)
               In Adobe Acrobat the CA entry value is provided via the label
    						field in the form control's Properties dialog.
            
            
               V
               Value
               The Value entry is set by the user interacting with the control,
    							where a value is needed.
            
            
               DV
               Default Value
               In Adobe Acrobat the DV entry value can be set in the form
    								control's Properties dialog.
            
         
      
      <p>The following table describes how the role, name, value, and state
    				are defined for PDF form controls created using Adobe Acrobat Pro.
    				Adobe LiveCycle Designer provides the same controls as well as several
    				additional ones: see Example 2 below. </p>

            <p>This example uses a check box for illustration; the procedure is the
    						same for other form controls. In Form Editing mode: </p>
            <ol>
               <li> Access the context menu for the form field you are creating or
    						modifying. </li>
               <li> Select the Properties... dialog for the form field. </li>
               <li> Specify the name by adding a value to the tool tip field. This
    							will used by the accessibility API as the Name for the control and
    							should usually be set to match the text used as a visual label for
    							the control. </li>
               <li> Select the Options tab. </li>
               <li> Specify the default value and the default state, if appropriate. </li>
            </ol>
            <p>The image below shows the Check Box Properties dialog, open in the
    						General tab. (The Name field in the dialog is not needed for accessibility.) </p>
            <p>
               
                  
                  General tab on the Check Box Properties dialog, showing name and tool tip fields for a check box
                
            </p>
            <p>The image below shows the Check Box Properties dialog, open in the
    						Options tab. </p>
            <p>
               
                  
                  Options tab on the Check Box Properties dialog, showing value and state fields for a check box.

            <p>In Adobe LiveCycle Designer, you use the Object Library to create
    						form objects and the Object Palette to specify name, role, state or

            <p>The following three images show the tabs in the Object palette. In
    						the first the Field tab is open for specifying the type (or role) of
