      <p use-id="pdf.applicability.general"></p>
   </section><section class="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The objective of this technique is to notify the user when user
    				input to a field that requires a specific, required format (e.g.,
    				date fields) is not submitted in that format. </p>
      <p>If the required format is not used, an alert dialog describes the
    				nature of the error in text. This may be accomplished through scripting
    				created by the author (see, for example, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2010/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20101014/SCR18">SCR18:
    					Providing client-side validation and alert</a>). User agents, such
    				as Adobe LiveCycle can provide automatic alerts (as described in
    				the examples below). </p>
      <div class="note">
         <p>Once the user dismisses the alert dialog,
    				it may be helpful if the script positions the keyboard focus on
    				the field where the error occurred, although some users may expect
    				the focus to remain on the last control focused prior to the alert
    				appearing. Authors should exercise care to ensure that any movement
    				of the focus will be expected. For example, if the alert announces
    				an error in a phone number format, positioning the focus on the
    				phone number field when the alert is dismissed can be regarded as
    				helpful and expected. In some cases, however, this may not be possible.
    				If multiple input errors occur on the page, an alternative approach
    				to error notification should be implemented. </p>
      </div>
      <p>Ensuring that users are aware an error has occurred, can determine
    				what is wrong, and can correct it are key to software usability
    				and accessibility. Meeting this objective helps ensure that all
    				users can complete for-based transactions with ease and confidence. </p>
      
         <h>Labels for required formats in form controls</h>
         <p>It is also important that users are aware that an error <em>may</em> occur.
    					You can incorporate this information in labels; for example, "Date
    					(MM/DD/YYYY)." See <a href="#PDF10"></a>. </p>

            <p>When a user types a recognized date format, it is converted automatically
    						to the specified format. If the date format or value is not recognized,
    						an error alert appears and provides further information, as shown
