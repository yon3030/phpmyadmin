			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p class="instructions">
				The purpose of this technique is to notify Assistive Technologies (AT) when content has been appended to sequential information concerning the application's history or logs. The aria live region role of <code>log</code> has an implicit <code>aria-live</code> value of "polite" and <code>aria-atomic</code> value of "false", which allows a user to be notified via AT (such as a screen reader) when log messages are added. The new content within the aria-live region is automatically read by the AT, without the AT having to focus on the place where the text is displayed. See <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#log">WAI-ARIA 1.1 log (role)</a> for more details.

			<h2>Examples</h2>
			<section class="example">
				<h3>Updating the contents of a chat conversation</h3>
				<p>Comments that users type into a chat input field are appended to the end of the chat history region. The region is marked with role of <code>log</code> so that new additions are announced by ATs. The <code>aria-relevant</code> attribute is set to be "additions" only so that removed or edited messages are not re-announced. When each new chat message appears, a screen reader announces its content.</p>
				<div class="code">
					<pre>
						<code>
							<div id="chatRegion" role="log" aria-labelledby="chatHeading">
								<h4 id="chatHeading">Chat History</h4>
								<ul id="conversation" aria-relevant="additions">
									<li>The latest chat message</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
						</code>
					</pre>

				<h3>Updating the log of a server</h3>
				<p>An application log records time-stamped activities. The log is exposed in the app as a view, with the region marked with the role of <code>log</code> so that the new additions are announced by the ATs. The <code>aria-relevant</code> attribute is set to "additions" since items removed from the top of the log are done only for size limitations. When each new log entry is added, a screen reader announces it.</p>
				<div class="code">
					<pre>
						<code>
							<div id="activityLog" role="log" aria-labelledby="logHeading">
								<h4 id="logHeading">Recent activity</h4>
								<ul id="logentries" aria-relevant="additions">
									<li>08:03 UserX logged off</li>
