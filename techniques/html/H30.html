      <p>HTML and XHTML documents that contain links, (&lt;a
            href&gt; elements)</p>
   </section><section class="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The objective of this technique is to describe the purpose of a link by providing
            descriptive text as the content of the a element. The description lets a
            user distinguish this link from other links in the Web page and helps the user determine
            whether to follow the link. The URI of the destination is generally not sufficiently
            descriptive. </p>
      <p>When an image is the only content of a link, the text alternative for the image
            describes the unique function of the link.</p>
      <p>When the content of a link contains both text and one or more images, if the text is
            sufficient to describe the purpose of the link, the images may have an empty text
            alternative. (See <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H67">Using null alt text and no title
              attribute on img elements for images that assistive technology should ignore</a>.)
            When the images convey information beyond the purpose of the link, they must also have
            appropriate alt text. </p>

            <p>A site allows users to provide feedback on products, when the user is logged in, by clicking on the "Feedback" link in a product detail page. Other users or the product manufacturer are able to provide a response to any feedback. The feedback link displays an icon before the "Feedback" text when a response to the user's feedback is available. The help information describes this icon as a talking bubble containing quotation marks and includes the icon itself as an example. The icon's text alternative in the help text is "Response received icon". The same text alternative is used in the product detail pages (when a response is available) to allow identification of this icon through multiple modalities.</p>

         <ol>
            <li>Check that text or a text alternative for non-text content is included in the

            <li>If the a element contains one or more img element(s)
                  and the text alternative of the img element(s) is empty, check that
                  the text of the link describes the purpose of the link </li>
