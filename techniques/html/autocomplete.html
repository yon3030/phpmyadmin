			<h2>When to Use</h2>
			<p class="instructions">This technique can be used on all form fields that map to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/sec-forms.html#autofilling-form-controls-the-autocomplete-attribute">HTML 5.2 autofill tokens</a>.</p>

			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p class="instructions"> The technique works by adding the appropriate autocomplete token to each form field on the form. This will help people with cognitive disabilities who may not immediately know the purpose of the field because the label used by the author is not familar to them, those who have trouble typing such those with dexterity disabilities, and generally helps anyone who needs more time to fill out a form. </p>
        
   <p>     The autocomplete attribute improves the browser's natural ability to remember form fields by explicity mapping it to a purpose for the field. It reduces typing by filling in details, it reduces reliance on memory because it uses stored values. It also gives third party plugins and software the ability to manipulate form fields to make them more accessible to people with cognitive disabilities. For instance, a plugin could sniff for an autocomplete token with the text string "tel" and insert a telephone icon. It will further enable third party software to swap out the labels for a text label that the user finds more familiar. For instance, it could change "Given Name" to "First Name".</p>
      
			<p>It's important to note that the success criteria only places requirements on input fields collecting information <em><strong>about the user</strong></em>.</p>
      <p>The objective of this technique is to make form fields easier to fill out and understand. </p>

    <section class="example">
				<h3>Example 1: Currency</h3>
				<p>In this example the page has explicitly specified the currency and amount of the transaction. The form requests a credit card and other billing details. The user agent could use this information to suggest a credit card that it knows has sufficient balance and that supports the relevant currency.</p>

<form method="post" action="step2">
 <div>
   <label for="fname">First Name</label>
  <input id="fname" type="text" autocomplete="given-name" ... >
  </div>
  <div>
    <label for="lname">Last Name Name</label>
  <input id="lname" type="text" autocomplete="family-name" ... >
    <label for="cc-num">Credit card number:</label>
    <input type="text" id="cc-num" autocomplete="cc-number">

  <div>
    <label for="exp-date">Expiry Date:</label>

				<h3>Procedure</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Step 1: Load page with form fields that collect information about the user and check if they have all have valid and well formed autocomplete values</li>
          <li>Step 2: Inspect the code to examine the input fields to determine if the purpose of the form field indicated by the label corresponds with the autocomplete token.</li>

				<h3>Expected Results</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>If Step 1 and Step 2 are true, then the test passes and the technique has been successfully implemented</li>
