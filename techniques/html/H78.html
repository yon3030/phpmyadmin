   </section><section class="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The objective of this technique is to identify the purpose of a link from the link in
            its paragraph context. The paragraph enclosing the link provides context for an
            otherwise unclear link when the paragraph is the nearest enclosing block-level ancestor
            element. The description lets a user distinguish this link from links in the Web page
            that lead to other destinations and helps the user determine whether to follow the link.
            Note that simply providing the URI of the destination is generally not sufficiently
            descriptive. </p>
      <div class="note">
         <p>These descriptions will be most useful to the user if the additional information
              needed to understand the link precedes the link. If the additional information follows
              the link, there can be confusion and difficulty for screen reader users who are
              reading through the page in order (top to bottom).</p>

      <section class="procedure"><h3>Procedure</h3>
         <p>For each link in the content that uses this technique:</p>
         <ol>
            <li> Check that the link is part of a paragraph. </li>
            <li> Check that text of the link combined with the text of its enclosing paragraph
                  describes the purpose of the link. </li>
         </ol>
