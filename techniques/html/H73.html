      <p>HTML 4.01, XHTML 1.x</p>
   </section><section class="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The objective of this technique is to provide a brief overview of how data has been organized into a table or a brief explanation of how to navigate the table. The summary attribute of the table element makes this information available to people who use screen readers; the information is not displayed visually.</p>
      <p>The summary is useful when the table has a complex structure (for example,
            when there are several sets of row or column headers, or when there are multiple groups
            of columns or rows). The summary may also be helpful for simple data tables
            that contain many columns or rows of data.</p>
      <p>The summary attribute may be used whether or not the table includes a
              caption element. If both are used, the summary should not
            duplicate the caption.</p>
      <div class="note"><p>In HTML5 the summary attribute is obsolete. Assistive technologies may or may not continue to support the attribute. Authors should consider alternatives and only use with caution.</p></div>
      <div class="note">
         <p> Although WCAG 2 does not prohibit the use of layout tables, CSS-based layouts are
               recommended in order to retain the defined semantic meaning of the HTML table
               elements and to conform to the coding practice of separating presentation from content.
               However, if a layout table is used, then the summary attribute is not used or
               is null. The purpose of a layout table is simply to control the placement of content;
               the table itself is “transparent" to the user. A summary would “break" this
               transparency by calling attention to the table. A null summary
                 (summary="") on layout tables is acceptable. See <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/F46">F46</a> for details.</p>
