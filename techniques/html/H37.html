      <p>Images used within HTML documents.</p>
   </section><section class="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>When using the img element, specify a short text alternative with the
            alt attribute. Note. The value of this attribute is referred to as "alt
            text".</p>
      <p>When an image contains words that are important to understanding the content, the alt
            text should include those words. This will allow the alt text to play the same function
            on the page as the image. Note that it does not necessarily describe the visual
            characteristics of the image itself but must convey the same meaning as the image. </p>

            <p>An image on a Website provides a link to a free newsletter. The image contains the
                text "Free newsletter. Get free recipes, news, and more. Learn more." The alt text
                matches the text in the image. </p>

            <p>An image on a Web site depicts the floor plan of a building. The image is an
              image map with each room an interactive map area. The alt text is "The
              building's floor plan. Select a room for more information about the purpose or
              content of the room." The instruction to "select a room" indicates that the
              image is interactive.</p>
