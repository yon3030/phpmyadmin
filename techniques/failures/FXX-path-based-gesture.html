		<section id="applicability">
			<h2>Applicability</h2>
			<p>All technologies that include interactive controls that can be triggered using a pointer.
This technique relates to Success Criterion 2.5.1: Pointer Gestures.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="description">
			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>The objective of this Failure is to describe situations where authors have implemented a function that is operated via a path-based gesture, and no alternative ways of operating this function via simple pointer gestures exist.</p>
      <p><em>Note:</em> For functionality implemented with a path-based gesture, the possibility of also operating it via the keyboard is beneficial (and may serve to meet Success Criterion 2.1.1 Keyboard). The point of Success Crtierion 2.5.1, however, is to ensure that pointer users who on many devices will have no keyboard available, have alternative ways of operating the function via simple pointer input.</p>

			<h2>Examples</h2>
			<section class="example">
	<ul>
  <li>A web application implements an interface where drawing a "Z" on the screen undos the last action. There is no other way to undo the action.</li>
  <li>A swipe-to-reveal control displays a set of options when swiping to the left, and another set of options when swiping to the right. One or several of these options are not available simple pointer activation after the item is first expanded with a single tap.</li>
  <li>A horizontal content slider can be swiped left and right to reveal options not currently visible in the viewport. The path-based gesture requires going through two points on the horizontal axis: The slider movement cannot be activated when moving the pointer first up and then left. There are no controls (arrows) that allow the activation of the same function via simple taps.</lil>
  </ul>

		<section id="tests">
			<h2>Tests</h2>
			<section class="test-procedure">
				<h3>Procedure</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Check if content implements any functions that can be activated via path-based gestures (one way might be to explore the content on a touch screen, another to check the page code for the existence of specific event handlers like touchstart or touchend).</li>
          <li>Check if the gesture for operation is indeed path-based, i.e., successful operation requires that from its start point, the path goes through at least one intermediate point. This defines the gesture as requiring a specific path (usually directional) even if the complete path is not defined.</li>
          <li>For any path-based gesture, check that no controls are available through which the same function can be carried out via simple taps or clicks.</li>
				</ol>
			</section>
			<section class="test-results">
				<h3>Expected Results</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>If #1, #2 and #3 are true then the content fails the Success Criterion.</li>
				</ul>
