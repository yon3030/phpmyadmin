   </section><section class="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>This technique describes a failure condition for images that should
            be ignored by assistive technologies. A text alternative for an image
            should convey the meaning of the image. When an image is used for decoration,
            spacing or other purpose that is not part of the meaningful content
            in the page then the image has no meaning and should be ignored by
            assistive technologies. </p>
      <p>Providing a null text alternative (i.e., alt="" )
            will allow assistive technology to ignore the image and avoid a failure
            of this Success Criterion. </p>

         <h3>Example 1: Decorative images that have no alt attribute</h3>
         <section class="description"><h2>Description</h2>
            <p>An image is used to create a blank space between content, where the
                spacing itself is not meaningful to the content. The image has an alt
                text value of "spacer". This image fails the Success Criterion
                because the text alternative does not serve an equivalent purpose.
                The image is meant to be ignored but its alternative text "spacer" is
                announced by screen readers and displayed in some alternate color schemes. </p>

      <section class="procedure"><h3>Procedure</h3>
         <ol>
            <li> Identify any img elements that are used for decoration, spacing
              or other purpose that is not part of the meaningful content in the
              page </li>
            <li> Check that the alt attribute for these elements is null. </li>

      <section class="results"><h3>Expected Results</h3>
         <ul>
            <li> If step #2 is false, this failure condition applies and the content
              fails the Success Criterion. </li>
