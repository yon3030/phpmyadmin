		<section id="applicability">
			<h2>Applicability</h2>
			<p >This techniques applies to text content created in markup languages that support text style properties.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="description">
			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p >The purpose of this technique is identify and test a failure condition where part of the content clips and is unreadable when the user overrides the spacing of the text within the boundaries set out in the Text Spacing success criteria. In general, this failure occurs when there is no way for a user agent's layout engine to honor all the layout hints in the HTML at the new font spacing. Some of the ways in which this can occur include:</p>
			<ul>
			  <li>
			   Setting the overflow property of the enclosing element to hidden
		      </li>
			  <li>
			   Using absolutely positioned content
		      </li>
			  <li>
			    Creating boarder that aren't big enough for their content at the new font spacing
		      </li>
		  </ul>

				<h3>Procedure</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Override the CSS on the page usng a user style sheet or a browser plugin with the maximum values listed in the success criteria, </li>
					<ol><li>Line height (line spacing) to at least 1.5 times the font size;</li>
					<li>Spacing following paragraphs to at least 2 times the font size;</li>
					<li>Letter spacing (tracking) to at least 0.12 times the font size;</li>
					<li>Word spacing to  0.16 times the font size.</li>
