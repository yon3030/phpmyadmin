    <h2>Applicability</h2>
    <p>This failure applies to web content that can be interacted with using a physical keyboard as input mechanism.</p>
    <p>The Failure relates to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#character-key-shortcuts">Success Criterion 2.1.4 Character Key
          Shortcuts</a></li>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Character key shortcuts using a single key such as a letter key (including upper- and lower-case letters),
      punctuation, number, or symbol characters can cause problems for people who use voice input on a computer or
      mobile device. When character key shortcuts are implemented, voice commands can inadvertently trigger functions,
      and the context of use is lost.</p>
    <p>Content must either not implement single character key shortcuts or offer settings to either turn off these
      shortcuts or to map them to keyboard shortcuts that employ an additional modifier key, like <kbd>ALT</kbd> or
      <kbd>STR</kbd>.</p>
    <p class="note">The use of a single key keyboard shortcut is not a Failure if the shortcut is only active when a particuar
      interface element has focus. For example, when a select element or a custom listbox has focus, the input of single
      character keys to navigate the list is a useful feature.</p>

  <section id="examples">
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <h3>Example 1</h3>
    <p>An application uses the single key shortcut S to bring up a search popup. There is no setting available to turn off or modify the shortcut.</p>

    <h2>Tests</h2>
    <section class="test-procedure">
      <h3>Procedure</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>If loading the page sets focus to an input, click on an empty part of the page to ensure that
          no inputs are in focus.</li>
        <li>Press all printing characters, i.e. all number, letter, sign and punctuation keys. Do not press non-printing
          modifier and control keys such as <kbd>STR</kbd>, <kbd>ALT</kbd>, <kbd>ESC</kbd>, Arrow keys and (where present) the function keys F1-F12. Also
          exempt are <kbd>space</kbd>, <kbd>ENTER</kbd>, <kbd>Return</kbd>, <kbd>Tab</kbd>, and the <kbd>Delete</kbd> key.</li>
		<li>Hold the <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> key and press the same keys again.</li>
		<li>Check whether a function has been triggered by pressing the keys</li>
        <li>Check whether the website or app provides settings to disable keyboard shortcuts using single character keys or map them to keyboard shortcuts that use a modifier key.</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Notes</h4>
      <p>The success criterion does not apply when single key shortcuts are only active when interface elements have the
        focus, for example, a <code>select</code> element. Here, pressing a letter key is used for fast navigation
        within the select options.</p>
      <p>Viewing page scripts and searching for typical keyboard event handlers like
        <code>document.addEventListener('keydown' ...) </code> or the presence of the <code>.keycode</code> attribute
        may establish the presence of scripts that intercept keyboard shortcuts without modification keys like ALT or
        STR being held down at the same time. As there are several ways of implementing character key events, this
        method is not considered reliable.</p>
      <p>Some browsers employ single key shortcuts with SHIFT. For example, Firefox opens a page search when pressing
        SHIFT + / and a search in page links when pressing SHIFT + '. In these cases, it will be necessary to press ESC
        or click an empty part of the page to remove the focus from the browser input.</p>

      <h3>Expected Results</h3>
      <p>If step #4 is true AND step #5 is false then this failure condition applies and the content fails the Success Criterion.</p>
