			<h2>Applicability</h2>
			<p>This failure applies to web content that can be interacted with using a physical keyboard as input mechanism.</p>
      <p>The Failure relates to:
        <ul><li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#character-key-shortcuts">Success Criterion 2.1.4 Character Key Shortcuts</a></li></ul>

			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>Character key shortcuts using a single key such as a letter key (including upper- and lower-case letters), punctuation, number, or symbol characters can cause problems for people who use voice input on a computer or mobile device. When character key shortcuts are implemented, voice commands can inadvertently trigger functions, and the context of use is lost.</p>
      <p>Content must either not implement single character key shortcuts or offer settings to either turn off these shortcuts or to map them to keyboard shortcuts that employ an additional modifier key, like ALT or STR.</p>
<p>Note: The use of a single key keyboard shortcut is not a Failure if the shortcut is only active when a particuar interface element has focus. For example, when a select element or a custom listbox has focus, the input of single character keys to navigate the list is a useful feature.</p>

			<h2>Examples</h2>
				<h3>Example 1</h3>
				<p>An application uses the single key shortcut S to bring up a search popup (looking for a realistic example here). There is no setting available to turn off or modify the shortcut.</p>

			<h2>Tests</h2>
			<section class="test-procedure">
				<h3>Procedure</h3>
				<ol>
<li>Reload page. If loading the page sets focus to an input, click on an empty part of the page to ensure that no inputs are in focus.</li>
<li>Press all printing characters, i.e. all number, letter, sign and punctuation keys. Do not press non-printing modifier and control keys such as STR, ALT, ESC, Arrow keys and (where present) the function keys F1-F12. Also exempt are space, ENTER, Return, Tab, and the Delete key.</li>
<li>Hold the SHIFT key and press the same keys again.</li>
<li>If the pressing of single character keys triggers any functions, check whether the website or app provides settings to disable keyboard shortcuts using single character keys or map them to keyboard shortcuts that use a modifier key.</li>
      </ol>
 <h4>Notes</h4>
 <p>The success criterion does not apply when single key shortcuts are only active when interface elements have the focus, for example, a <code>select</code> element. Here, pressing a letter key is used for fast navigation within the select options.</p>
<p>Viewing page scripts and searching for typical keyboard event handlers like <code>document.addEventListener('keydown' ...) </code> or the presence of the <code>.keycode</code> attribute may establish the presence of scripts that intercept keyboard shortcuts without modification keys like ALT or STR being held down at the same time. As there are several ways of implementing character key events, this method is not considered reliable.</p>
<p>Some browsers employ single key shortcuts with SHIFT. For example, Firefox opens a page search when pressing SHIFT + / and a search in page links when pressing SHIFT + '. In these cases, it will be necessary to press ESC or click an empty part of the page to remove the focus from the browser input.</p>

				<h3>Expected Results</h3>
				<ul>
<li>No changes are triggered to the page content or context by pressing single character keys.</li>
<li>There are keyboard shortcuts via single character keys, but these can be switched off via settings of the website or app or mapped to key combinations with modifier keys.</li>
</ul>
