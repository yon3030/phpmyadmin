   </section><section class="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>This describes a failure condition when the context needed for understanding the purpose of a link is located in content that is not programmatically determined link context.  If the context for the link is not provided in one of the following ways:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>in the same sentence, paragraph, list item, or table cell as the link</li>
         <li>in the preceding heading</li>
         <li>via a suitable ARIA property such as aria-label or aria-labelledby
            </li>
      </ul>
      <p>then the user will not be able to find out where the link is going with any ease. If the user must leave the link to search for the context, the context is not programmatically determined link context and this failure condition occurs.</p>

         <h3>Example 1: A Link in an Adjacent Paragraph</h3>
         <section class="description"><h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
A news service lists the first few sentences of an article in a paragraph. The next paragraph contains the link "Read More...". Because the link is not in the same paragraph as the lead sentence, the user cannot easily discover what the link will let the user read more about.</p>

      <section class="procedure"><h3>Procedure</h3>
         <p>Locate links where some additional link context is needed to understand the purpose of the link. For each link:</p>
         <ol>
            <li>
Check whether the context is contained in the same sentence, paragraph, list item, table cell, associated table headers, or preceding heading.</li>
            <li>Check whether the link context can be programmatically determined in some other way, for example, by using a WAI-ARIA property such as aria-label, aria-labelledby or aria-describedby on the link to provide sufficient context</li>
         </ol>
      </section>
      <section class="results"><h3>Expected Results</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>If check #1 AND check #2 are false, the content fails the Success Criterion.</li>
