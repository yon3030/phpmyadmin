      <p>When pointing device-specific event handlers are the only mechanism available
                        to invoke a function of the content, users with no vision (who cannot use
                        devices such as mice that require eye-hand coordination) as well as users
                        who must use alternate keyboards or input devices that act as keyboard
                        emulators will be unable to access the function of the content. </p>

            <p>The following example is of an image that responds to a mouse click
                                to go to another page. This is a failure because the keyboard cannot
                                be used to move to the next page.  
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img onmousedown="nextPage();" src="nextarrow.gif" 
alt="Go to next page"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
