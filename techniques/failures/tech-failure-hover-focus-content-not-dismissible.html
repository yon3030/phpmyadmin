			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>The objective of this failure is to describe a situation where users find it difficult or impossible to dismiss popup content without moving the pointer or the keyboard focus. Content on hover or focus (popup content) appears on top of other page content when hovering over particular elements or keyboard-focusing these elements. For users of screen magnification software, the position of the magnified section of the screen is often centered on their current focus position. Having to move the focus to dismiss popup content automatically moves this section and in turn, the content that the user may want to view after dismissig the popup. This can severely impede the use of content that may be partly or fully covered.</p>

			<h2>Examples</h2>
<ul>
	<li>A pop-up opens on pointer hover and when the trigger receives keyboard focus, obstructing the visibility of content on the page. The pop-up closes automatically when tabbing beyond the trigger or moving the pointer. However, there is no way to close the pop-up via the ESC key or some other documented keyboard command.</li>
 <li>A pop-up opens on pointer hover and when the trigger receives keyboard focus and obscures other page content. The pop-up stays open when tabbing to other links, obstructing the visibility of content on the page. There is a close button in the popup but it can only be activated using pointer input and/or tabbing to that button, which changes the focus position. There is no way to close the pop-up via the ESC key or some other documented keyboard command or by activating the trigger again.</li>

				<h3>Procedure</h3>
        <p>For each area of content that appears from a hover or focus event check whether:</p>
				<ol>
    <li>Activating the trigger dismisses the content.</li>
    <li>The ESC key dismisses the content.</li>
    <li>Any other keyboard shortcut dismisses the content.</li>
				</ol>

			<section class="test-results">
				<h3>Expected Results</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>If #2, #3, and #4 are false, then content fails the Success Criterion.</li>
