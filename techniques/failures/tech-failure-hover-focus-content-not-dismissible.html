			<p>The Technique is applicable to any technology that supports the display of additional content on pointer hover or keyboard focus.</p>

			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>The objective of this failure is to describe a situation where users find it difficult or impossible to dismiss popup content without moving the pointer or the keyboard focus. Content on hover or focus (popup content) appears on top of other page content when hovering over particular elements or keyboard-focusing these elements. For users of screen magnification software, the position of the magnified section of the screen is often centered on their current focus position. Having to move the focus to dismiss popup content automatically moves this section and in turn, the content that the user may want to view after dismissig the popup. This can severely impede the use of content that may be partly or fully covered.</p>

			<h2>Examples</h2>
<ul>
	<li>When moving the pointer over a link or when keyboard-focussing that link, a page displays a pop-up that obscures content. The pop-up stays open. A close-button im the popup can only be activated using pointer input. The pop-up stays open when tabbing to other links, obstructing the visibility of content on the page. Closing the pop-up via the ESC key or some other documented keyboard command is not implemented.</li>
    <li>When moving the pointer over a link or when keyboard-focussing that link, a page displays a pop-up that obscures content. The pop-up closes automatically when moving the pointer or tabbing to the next focusable element, but cannot be dismissed while the pointer or keyboard focus stays on the trigger that opened the close-up, for example, by activating the trigger or by using a keyboard command like ESC.</li>

			<h2>Tests</h2>
			<section class="test-procedure">
				<h3>Procedure</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Determine if content appears when moving hover or keyboard focus onto triggering elements of the page, such as links or buttons. If this is the case:</li>
    <li>Check if activating the trigger dismisses the content</li>
    <li>Check if the ESC key dismisses the content.</li>
    <li>Check if any other documented keyboard shortcut dismisses the content.</li>
				</ol>
			</section>
			<section class="test-results">
				<h3>Expected Results</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>If #1 is true, and neither option of #2, #3, #4 is true, then content fails the Success Criterion.</li>
				</ul>
