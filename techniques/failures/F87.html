      <p>All technologies that support CSS.</p>
   </section><section id="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The CSS :before and :after pseudo-elements specify the location of content before and after an element's document tree content. The content property, in conjunction with these pseudo-elements, specifies what is inserted. For users who need to customize or turn off style information in order to view content according to their needs, they may not be able to access the information that is inserted using CSS. Therefore, it is a failure to use these properties to insert non-decorative content.</p>

      <section class="example">
         
            <p>In the following example, :before and :after are used to indicate speaker changes and to insert quotation marks in a screenplay.</p>
            <p>The CSS contains:</p>
         
         <pre xml:space="preserve"> p.jim:before {	content: "Jim: " }
p.mary:before { content: "Mary: " }

q:before { content: open-quote }
q:after  { content: close-quote }</pre>
         
            <p>It is used in this excerpt:</p>
         
         <pre xml:space="preserve"> &lt;p class="jim"&gt;
 &lt;q&gt;Do you think he's going to make it?&lt;/q&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="mary"&gt;
 &lt;q&gt;It's not looking good.&lt;/q&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
      </section>
      <section class="example">
         
            <p>In this example, :before is used to differentiate facts from opinions.</p>
            <p>The CSS contains:</p>
         
         <pre xml:space="preserve"> p.fact:before { content: "Fact: "; font-weight: bold; }
 p.opinion:before { content: "Opinion: "; font-weight: bold; }</pre>
         
            <p>It is used in this excerpt:</p>
         
         <pre xml:space="preserve"> &lt;p class="fact"&gt;
 The defendant was at the scene of the crime when it occurred. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="opinion"&gt;
 The defendant committed the crime.

         <ol>
            <li>Examine all content inserted through use of the :before and :after pseudo-elements and the content property</li>
            <li>Verify that the content is decorative.</li>
            <li>If the inserted content is not decorative, check that the information is available when the :before and :after styles are overriden, or when CSS is turned off.</li>
