			<h2>When to Use</h2>
			<p class="instructions">This technique applies to nearly all technologies.</p>

			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p class="instructions">The objective of this technique is to ensure that users who attempt to interact with a control do not trigger the action of the event accidentally. This can be accomplished most directly by relying on the “pointer up” event. This allows users interacting with touch screens to utilize the screen as support to stabilize the activation target. Another approach would be to activate on the “pointer down” event, but if the “pointer up” event occurs outside of the control, to immediately undo the action.</p>

		<section id="examples">
			<h2>Examples</h2>
			<p class="instructions">Copy the following section for each example. Examples must have a title and a description, and usually have a code sample. Code samples should be elided if necessary to show the core of the technique without necessarily providing all the surrounding code that would also be involved. A working example link references a location where the technique can be shown working live.</p>
			<section class="example">
				<h3>Example Title</h3>
				<p>An Editable Text box could have the cursor enter the editable area on the “pointer down” event, because the action is trivially reversible, any text is easy to delete.
However, a Submit button would need to either provide a confirmation dialogue or have its event occur on the “pointer up” event. A key on a keyboard application could respond on the “pointer down” event because such behavior would be considered essential for that control.</p>

			<h2>Tests</h2>
			<p class="instructions">Tests must have a test procedure and expected results. Populate the following sections as appropriate. If a technique has multiple alternative testing approaches, add a new section with class="test" for each one, and put the test-procedure and test-results sections inside that.</p>
			<section class="test-procedure">
				<h3>Procedure</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Step 1</li>

				<h3>Expected Results</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Result</li>
