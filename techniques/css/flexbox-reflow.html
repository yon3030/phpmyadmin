			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p class="instructions">Describe how the technique works. This begins with a description of the problem the technique solves, then describes how to apply the technique. The description should be detailed enough to provide all the information a reader needs to be able to apply the technique, without recourse to following example code.</p>
			<p>The objective of this technique is to be able to present content without introducing a horizontal scroll bar at a width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels and a vertical scroll bar at a height equivalent to 256 CSS pixels. This is done by using layout techniques that adapt to the available viewport space. Flexbox layouts define layout regions that reflow as needed to display the region on the screen. Although the exact layout therefore varies, the relationship of elements and the reading order remains the same when done right. This is an effective way to create designs that present well on different devices and for users with different zoom preferences.</p>
      <p>The basic principles of flexbox layouts are to:</p>
      <ol>
        
         <li>Define the size of layout regions using flexbox properties and media queries for specific viewport sizes, so they enlarge, shrink or wrap in the available space and respond to zoom levels;</li>       
         <li>Position the layout regions in the flexbox container as a row of adjacent flex boxes items, which may wrap to new rows as needed in much the same way as words in a paragraph wrap.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Complex flexbox layouts may be achieved by nesting layout regions, thus creating localized flexbox layouts within a larger flexbox layout. Even simple flexbox layouts require design finesse to achieve good-looking results at a wide range of viewport sizes and zoom levels, but well-designed flexbox layouts can be the most effective page design.</p>
      <p>NOTE: Flexbox has the possibility to cause a keyboard navigation disconnect by using the order and reverse properties. The CSS Flexible Box Layout module warns against resequencing content logic as they cause incorrect source ordering and are non-conforming.</p>

			<h2>Examples</h2>
			<p class="instructions">Copy the following section for each example. Examples must have a title and a description, and usually have a code sample. Code samples should be elided if necessary to show the core of the technique without necessarily providing all the surrounding code that would also be involved.

				<h3>Example 1: Simple liquid layout in HTML and CSS</h3>
				<p>
          The following medium complex example uses HTML and CSS to create a flexbox layout.
          The layout regions adjust their size as the viewport is adjusted.
          When the total viewport width matches the width defined via media queries, columns wrap to be positioned below, rather than beside each other or vice versa.
          The zoom level can be increased to 400% without requiring scrolling in more than one direction.
          This particular example uses percent sizes for the flex items by using the "flex-basis" property and are laid out in source order.</p>

          &lt;div class="row"&gt;
  &lt;header role="banner" class="col"&gt;

  &lt;/header&gt;
  &lt;main role="main" class="col"&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Main&lt;/h2&gt;
