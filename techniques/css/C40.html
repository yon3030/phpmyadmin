			<h2>When to Use</h2>
			<p class="instructions">Components on a page are often many colors and shades. Historically focus indicators have been  one color, so they are highly visible when some components have focus and not well seen on other components. For instance, if a focus indicator is dark blue and a button is yellow then it will be well seen, but if the button is also blue it will not be well seen. This technique overcomes that problem with one class that can be used across a site.</p>

			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p class="instructions">Although it is possible to create individual CSS classes to address the different buttons across a site, this can be time consuming and easy to miss some types of interactive content. However, if the focus indicator is two colors, a light color and a dark color, then regardless of the color of component it is on, it will always have sufficient contrast. Currently, this can be done by combining the <code>text shadow</code>property with the <code>outline </code> property on the <code>focus</code> indicator.  </p>
			<p>The objective of this technique is to create a two color focus indicator that is always visible and does not require multiple classes to ensure constant sufficient contrast of the focus indicator regardless of the color of the component it is focused on.</p>

			<h2>Examples</h2>
			<p class="instructions">Copy the following section for each example. Examples must have a title and a description, and usually have a code sample. Code samples should be elided if necessary to show the core of the technique without necessarily providing all the surrounding code that would also be involved. A working example link references a location where the technique can be shown working live.</p>

				<h3>Combining a dark outline and light text shadow</h3>
				<p>Description</p>
				<code>
        *:focus {
                      box-shadow: 0 0 0px 1px white !important;
                      outline: dotted !important;
                       }
         *:focus:not(:focus-visible) { outline: none }
          a:hover { outline: none !important;}
          a:active { outline: none !important;}</code>

				<h3>Using a single CSS property</h3>
				<p>	As of this writing there is no one CSS setting that can accomplish this, but there is movement to introduce a new CSS property that could accept <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/1172>two colors of outline</a>. It will be added here if and when it is available.</p>

      <h2>Tests</h2>
			
			<section class="test-procedure">
				<h3>Procedure</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Step 1: Load a page with light and dark interactive elements and/or light and dark backgrounds</li>
          <li>Step 2: Press the tab key to move the focus ring between the elements</li>
    
				</ol>
			</section>
			<section class="test-results">
				<h3>Expected Results</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>The focus indicator is always be visible and have a sufficient contrast ratio of 3:1 with adjacent components as the user tabs through the page. The light color is visible  on a dark components or backgrounds and the dark color is visible  a light colored components or backgrounds</li>
