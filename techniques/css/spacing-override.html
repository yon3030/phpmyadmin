         <h2>Description</h2>
         <p>The objective of this technique is to show how to test for a text spacing override. Increased spacing between  paragraphs, lines, words, and letters  benefits  people who override author settings via user stylesheet, bookmarklet, extension, or application. An author's content needs to have the ability to be set to  Success Criterion 1.4.12's metrics without loss of content or functionality. The author requirement is two-fold:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>to not interfere with a user's ability to override the author settings, and</li>
            <li>to ensure that content modified to Success Criterion 1.4.12's metrics does not break content.</li>
         </ul>

         <h2>Examples
         </h2>
         <section class="example">
            <p>When a user adapts the page to increase the text spacing, text fits within the bounds of its containing box.
            </p>
            <h3>Example 1: Small areas of text</h3>
            <p>Small areas of text (such as navigation bars) have sufficient space within each box so that words and letters do not expand out of their containers.</p>
            <h3>Example 2:  Paragraphs of text</h3>
            <p>Paragraphs allow text to increase vertically (in languages such as English which are read horizontally).

            <h3>Procedure</h3>
            <p>First, you will need a mechanism to apply the text spacing metrics. You can either use the <a href="http://www.html5accessibility.com/tests/tsbookmarklet.html">Text Spacing Bookmarklet</a> (this works for sites without content security policies), or you can install a user-style browser plugin to add the following rules:</p>
            <code>* {<br>
            line-height: 1.5 !important;<br>
            }<br>
            p {<br>
            margin-bottom: 2em !important;<br>
            }<br>
            * {<br>
            letter-spacing: 0.12em !important;<br>
            }<br>
            * {<br>
            word-spacing: 0.16em !important;<br>
            } </code>
            <p>Then,</p>
            <ol>
               <li>Set zoom level to 100%.</li>
               <li>Visit the page to be tested.</li>
               <li>Apply the text spacing styles.</li>
            </ol>
         </section>
         <section class="test-results">
            <h3>Expected Results</h3>
            <ul>
               <li>No loss of essential content or functionality occurs.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Note</strong>: Where a page has multiple layouts (e.g. in a responsive design) text spacing should be tested in each layout. </p>
