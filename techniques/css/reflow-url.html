<h1>Allowing for Reflow with Long URLs</h1>
<section id="meta"></section>

  <h2>When to Use</h2>
  <p class="instructions">This technique is applicable to Cascading Style Sheet / HTML technologies.</p>

  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Long URLs can break reflow when the page is zoomed. The objective of this technique is to present URLs without introducing a horizontal scroll bar at a width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels or a vertical scroll bar at a height equivalent to 256 CSS pixels. This is done by using CSS techniques that adapt to the available viewport space. Note: Using a human readable text link, rather than a long URL, is better for usability and accessibility.</p>
  <p>By default most browsers will wrap long URLs at the following characters:   
  <ul>
    <li>&quot;-&quot; Hyphen  </li>
    <li>&quot; &quot; Space</li>
    <li>"?" Question (IE,  Chrome, Safari) </li>
    <li>&quot;&amp;&quot; Ampersand (Firefox only)</li>
  </ul> 
  Sometimes these are not enough to ensure that long URLs will not overflow the viewport.

  <h2>Examples</h2>
  <p class="instructions"></p>
  <section class="example">
    <h3>Example: Breaking long URLs</h3>
    <p>Using the following CSS will cause long URLs to break at appropriate places (hyphens, spaces, etc.) and within words without causing reflow. </p>
    <p>List of CSS declarations used and why they are used:</p>
    <ul>
     <li><strong>overflow-break: break-word</strong>: Allows words to be broken and wrapped between letters. </li>
	    <li><strong>word-break: break-word</strong>: Allows words to be broken and wrapped between letters. (Microsoft only)</li>
    </ul>
    <pre>    .wrapped {overflow-wrap: break-word;}</pre>
    <p>Note:  IE and Edge  only support this declaration when used with the following declaration.</p>
    <pre>    /* specific for IE10 & 11, they do not support these declarations with "a" selector */<br>
    @media screen and (-ms-high-contrast: active), (-ms-high-contrast: none) {<br>
         * { word-wrap: break-word;}<br>
    }<br><br>
    /* for all Edge, does not support these declarations with "a" selector */<br>
    @supports (-ms-ime-align:auto) {<br>
        * { word-wrap: break-word;}<br>
    }</pre>

  <h2>Tests</h2>
  <section class="test-procedure">
    <h3>Procedure</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Display content in a user agent capable of 400% zoom with a viewport-width of 1280 CSS pixels.</li>
      <li>If the text is read horizontally: Zoom in by 400%.   
      <li>Check whether URL content and functionality is available without horizontal scrolling.</li>
      <li>If the text is read vertically: Set the viewport height to 256 CSS pixels.</li>
      <li>Check whether URL content and functionality is available without vertical scrolling.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Note: If the browser is not capable of zooming to 400%, you can reduce the width of the browser proportionally. For example, at 300% zoom the viewport should be sized to 960px wide.</p>
    <ol>
	    <li>Display content in a user agent with a Responsive Design Mode feature.</li>
      <li>Turn on the Responsive Design Mode - set width to 320 pixels or select a device with width of 320 pixels.
      <li>Check whether URL content and functionality is available without horizontal scrolling.</li>
      <li>If the text is read vertically: Set the viewport height to 256 CSS pixels.</li>
      <li>Check whether URL content and functionality is available without vertical scrolling.</li>
