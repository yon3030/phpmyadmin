	<h2>Common Purposes for User Interface Components</h2>
	<p>This section contains a listing of common <a>user interface component</a> purposes. The terms below are not keywords which must be used, but instead represent purposes that must be captured in the taxonomy adopted by a webpage. Where applicable, authors mark up controls with the chosen taxonomy to indicate the semantic purpose. This provides the potential for user agents and assistive technologies to apply personalized presentations that can enable more people to understand and use the content.</p>
	<p class="ednote">The particular set of items in the lists below is <a href="#further-work">still being refined</a>. The Working Group is interested in comments on this list. If you have strong views about the output of this discussion, please follow <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag21/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%7Ecomment-purpose-of-controls">discussion in progress on control purpose issues</a>.</p>

        <h2>Common Input Control Purposes</h2>
        <p>The following input control purposes are intended to relate to the user of the content and pertain only to information related to that individual.</p>
        <p class="ednote">Editor’s Note: The intention of the Working Group is to scope the terms and definitions of the Control Purposes to be only about the user of the content. The note above was included to clarify this but some concerns have been raised that this is insufficient and that each definition should clarify this, in order to avoid authors thinking that they need to implement support for more controls than is necessary. The Working Group is interested in feedback on this specific question.</p>
