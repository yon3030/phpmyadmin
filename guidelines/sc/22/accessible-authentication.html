    <h4>Accessible Authentication</h4>
    
    <p class="conformance-level">AA</p>
	<p class="change">New</p>
    
    <p>For each step in an authentication process that relies on a <a>cognitive function test</a> (such as remembering a password or solving a puzzle), at least one other authentication method is available that does not rely on a cognitive function test, or a mechanism is available to assist the user in completing the cognitive function test.</p>
    <p>Exception: The cognitive function test asks the user to recognize objects, or to recognize non-text content that the user provided to the website.</p>

    <p class="note">Objects and content for the exception may be represented by images, video or audio.</p>
    <div class="note">Examples of mechanisms that satisfy this criterion include:
        <ol>
            <li>support for password entry by password managers to reduce memory need, and</li>
            <li>copy and paste to reduce the cognitive burden of re-typing.</li>
        </ol>
