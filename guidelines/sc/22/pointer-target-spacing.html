    <h4>Pointer Target Spacing</h4>
    
    <p class="conformance-level">AA</p>
	<p class="change">New</p>
    
    <p>For each <a>target</a>, there is an area with a width and height of at least 44 CSS pixels that includes it, and no other targets, except when:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Enlarge:</strong> A mechanism is available to change the CSS pixel size of each target, or its spacing, so there is an area with a width and height of at least 44 CSS pixels that includes it, and no other targets;</li>
        <li><strong>Inline:</strong> The target is in a sentence or block of text;</li>
        <li><strong>User agent:</strong> The size of the target is controlled by the user agent and is not modified by the author;</li>
        <li><strong>Essential:</strong> A particular presentation of the target is essential to the information being conveyed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">This criterion has been formulated to increase the hit-area of small targets, but the group would like feedback from providers of touch-screen devices if there is another way of forming the criteria to better complement the tap-heuristics used.</p>
    <p class="note">Are there issues with internationalization when describing inline links?</p>
    <p class="note">Are there issues with pop-over content overlapping targets triggering failures?</p>
