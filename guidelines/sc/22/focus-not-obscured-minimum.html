    <p>When a <a>user interface component</a> receives keyboard focus, the component is not entirely hidden due to author-created content.</p>

    <p class="note">Where content in a configurable interface can be repositioned by the user, then only the initial positions of user-movable content is considered for testing and conformance of this Success Criterion.</p>

    <p class="note">Where the user initiates the disclosure of additional content, such disclosed content is not considered to fully obscure focus if the user can reveal the item with focus, using the keyboard (for example, by dismissing with Esc or reorienting the viewport by scrolling).</p>
