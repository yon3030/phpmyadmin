    <p>When a <a>user interface component</a> receives keyboard focus, the component is not entirely hidden due to author-created content.</p>

    <p class="note">If the interface is configurable so that the user can reposition content such as toolbars and non-modal dialogs, then only the initial positions of user-movable content would be considered for testing and conformance of this Success Criterion.</p>
