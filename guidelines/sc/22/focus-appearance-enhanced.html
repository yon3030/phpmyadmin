    <p>For the keyboard focus indicator of each <a>user interface component</a>, all of the following are true:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Minimum area:</strong> The <a>focus indicator area</a> is greater than or equal to a 2 <a>CSS pixel</a> solid border around the component.</li>
        <li><strong>Change of contrast:</strong> Color changes used to indicate focus have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 with the colors changed from the unfocused component.</li>
        <li><strong>Not obscured:</strong> No part of the focus indicator is hidden by author-created content.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">A keyboard focus indicator which has a pattern or gradient may have parts that do not meet the 4.5:1 contrast ratio for the change of contrast, as long as an area equal to the minimum does meet the contrast ratio.</p>
