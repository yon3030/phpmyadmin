    <p>When <a>user interface components</a> have keyboard focus, all of the following are true:</p>
    <ul>
       <li><strong>Minimum area:</strong> The <a>focus indicator area</a> is double the area of a 1 <a>CSS pixel</a> perimeter of the unfocused component;</li>
       <li><strong>Change of contrast:</strong> The pixels making up the minimum focus indicator area achieve at least a 4.5:1 contrast ratio between their colors in the focused and unfocused states.</li>
       <li><strong>Not obscured:</strong> No part of the focus indicator is hidden by author-created content.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">A keyboard focus indicator which has a pattern or gradient may have parts that do not meet the 4.5:1 contrast ratio for the change of contrast, as long as an area equal to the minimum does meet the contrast ratio.</p>
