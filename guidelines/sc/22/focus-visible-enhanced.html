    <h4>Focus Visible (Enhanced)</h4>
    
    <p class="conformance-level">AA</p>
    
    <p>When a <a>User Interface Component</a> displays a visible keyboard <a>focus</a>, all of the following are true:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Minimum area:</strong> The <a>focus indication area</a> is greater than or equal to the longest side of the bounding rectangle of the focused control, times 2 <a>CSS pixels</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Focus contrast:</strong> Color changes used to indicate focus have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with the colors changed from the unfocused control.</li>
        <li><strong>Contrast or thickness:</strong> The focus indication area has a 3:1 contrast ratio against all adjacent colors for the minimum area or greater, or has a thickness of at least 2 CSS pixels.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">A focus indicator that is larger than the minimum area may have parts that do not meet the 3:1 contrast ratio, as long as an area equal to the minimum does meet the contrast ratio.</p>
