    <h4>Focus Appearance (Minimum)</h4>

    <p>When user interface components receive keyboard focus, all of the following are true:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Minimum area:</strong> The area of the <a>focus indicator</a> is at least as large as the area of a 1 <a>CSS pixel</a> thick <a>perimeter</a> of the unfocused control, or the focus indicator has a thickness of at least 8 CSS pixels along the shortest side of the user interface component.</li>      
        <li><strong>Change of contrast:</strong> The pixels making up the minimum focus indicator area achieve at least a 3:1 contrast ratio between their colors in the focused and unfocused states.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjacent contrast:</strong> The pixels in the minimum focus indicator area achieve at least a 3:1 against adjacent colors in the focused control or the minimum focus indicator area has a thickness of at least 2 CSS pixels.</li>
        <li><strong>Not fully obscured:</strong> The item with focus is not entirely hidden by author-created content.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">A keyboard focus indicator which has a pattern or gradient may have parts that do not meet the 3:1 contrast ratio for the change of contrast, as long as an area equal to the minimum does meet the contrast ratio.</p>
    <p class="note">If the control has a visible boundary smaller than the hit area, the size measure is taken from the visible boundary.</p>
    <p class="ednote">The working group is interested in feedback about the minimum area metric, and if there are unusual scenarios where visible indicators are caught by the wording.</p>
