    <p><a>Targets</a> have an area of at least 24 by 24 CSS pixels, except if:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> The offset between adjacent targets is at least 24 CSS pixels, where the offset is measured from the farthest point of one target to the nearest point of each adjacent target including spacing;</li>
        <li><strong>Inline:</strong> The target is in a sentence or block of text;</li>
        <li><strong>Essential:</strong> A particular presentation of the target is essential to the information being conveyed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">Targets that allow for values to be selected spatially based on position within the target are considered one target for the purpose of the success criterion. Examples include sliders with granular values, color pickers displaying a gradient of colors, or editable areas where you position the cursor.</p>
    <p class="ednote">Are there issues with internationalization when describing inline links?</p>
    <p class="ednote">Are there issues with pop-over content overlapping targets triggering failures?</p>
