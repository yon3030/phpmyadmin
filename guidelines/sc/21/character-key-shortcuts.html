  <p>If a <a>keyboard shortcut</a> consisting entirely of one or more <a>character keys</a> is implemented in content, then a mechanism is available to turn it off or to remap it to a shortcut that can use at least one non-character key, unless the keyboard shortcut for a <a>user interface component</a> is only active when that component has focus.</p>
