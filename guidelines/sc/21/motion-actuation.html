   <p><a>Functionality</a> which can be operated by device motion or user motion can also be operated by <a>user interface components</a> and can be disabled to prevent accidental actuation, except when:</p>
   
   <dl>
   
   <dt>Accessibility Supported</dt>
   <dd>The motion is used to operate a keyboard, pointer, or <a>assistive technology</a>;</dd>
   
   <dt>Essential</dt>
