   <p>Content can be zoomed to an equivalent width of 320 <a>CSS pixels</a> without loss of content or functionality, 
     and without requiring scrolling on more than one axis, except for parts of the content which require 
     two-dimensional layout for usage or meaning.</p>
  
   <p class="note">320 CSS pixels is equivalent to a starting viewport width of 1280 CSS pixels wide at 400% zoom. 
     For web pages which are designed to scroll horizontally, the 320px should be taken as the height rather than width.</p>
   
   <p class="note">Examples of content which require two-dimensional layout are images, maps, diagrams, 
     video, games, presentations, data tables, and interfaces where it is necessary to keep toolbars in view while
     manipulating content.</p>
