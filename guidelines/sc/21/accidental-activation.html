   <p>For <a>single-pointer activation</a>, at least one of the following is true:</p>
   					
   <ul>
     <li>Activation is on the <a>up-event</a>, either explicitly or implicitly as a platform's generic
         activation/click event;
      </li>
      						
      <li>A mechanism is available that allows the user to choose the up-event as an option;</li>
      						
      <li>Confirmation is provided, which can dismiss activation;</li>
      						
      <li>Activation is reversible;</li>
      						
     <li>Down-event activation event is <a>essential</a> and waiting for the up-event would invalidate the activity. 
      </li>
      					
   </ul>
