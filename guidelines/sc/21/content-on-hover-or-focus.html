    	<p>When a <a>user interface component</a> which receives keyboard focus or pointer hover causes content to become visible, the following are true:</p>

  <dl>

    <dt>Visible Trigger</dt>
    <dd>Either the additional content does not obscure any <a>essential</a> content within the triggering user interface component, or the additional content can be closed or repositioned by the user;</dd>

    <dt>Hover</dt>
   <dd>If the additional content is triggered via pointer hover, then that content remains visible when the pointer is moved over it;</dd>

    <dt>Focus</dt>
    <dd>The additional content remains visible while the triggering user interface component has keyboard focus, unless the user dismisses the additional content.</dd>

  </dl>
    	
    	<p>Exception: The visual presentation of the content is controlled by the user agent and is not modified by the author.</p>

    	<p class="note">Examples of additional content controlled by the user agent include browser tooltips created through use of the HTML <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/dom.html#the-title-attribute"><code>title</code> attribute</a>.</p>
     <p class="note">Custom tooltips, sub-menus, and other nonmodal popups which display on hover and focus are examples of additional content covered by this criterion.</p>
