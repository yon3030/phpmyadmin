    	<p>When pointer hover or keyboard focus triggers additional content to become visible, the following are true:</p>

  <dl>

    <dt>Visible Trigger</dt>
    <dd>Either the additional content does not obscure any <a>essential</a> content within the triggering user interface component, or the additional content can be closed or repositioned by the user;</dd>

    <dt>Hoverable</dt>
   <dd>If pointer hover can trigger the additional content, then the pointer can be moved to hover the additional content.;</dd>

    <dt>Persistent</dt>
    <dd>The additional content remains visible until the user dismisses it or its information is no longer valid.</dd>

  </dl>
    	
    	<p>Exception: The visual presentation of the additional content is controlled by the user agent and is not modified by the author.</p>

    	<p class="note">Examples of additional content controlled by the user agent include browser tooltips created through use of the HTML <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/dom.html#the-title-attribute"><code>title</code> attribute</a>.</p>
     <p class="note">Custom tooltips, sub-menus, and other nonmodal popups which display on hover and focus are examples of additional content covered by this criterion.</p>
