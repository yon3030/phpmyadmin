   <p>Content can be presented without loss of information or functionality, and without requiring scrolling in two dimensions for:</p>
   <ul>
       <li>Vertical scrolling content at a width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels;</li>
       <li>Horizontal scrolling content at a height equivalent to 256 CSS pixels;</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Except for parts of the content which require two-dimensional layout for usage or meaning.</p>
  
   <p class="note">Note: 320 CSS pixels is equivalent to a starting viewport width of 1280 CSS pixels wide at 400% zoom. For web content which are designed to scroll horizontally (e.g. with vertical text), the 256 CSS pixels is equivalent to a starting viewport height of 1024px at 400% zoom.</p>
   
   <p class="note">Examples of content which require two-dimensional layout are images, maps, diagrams, 
     video, games, presentations, data tables, and interfaces where it is necessary to keep toolbars in view while
     manipulating content.</p>
