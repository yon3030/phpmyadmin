   <p>Content can be presented at a width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels without loss of information or functionality, and without requiring scrolling in two dimensions, except for parts of the content which require two-dimensional layout for usage or meaning.</p>
  
   <p class="note">320 CSS pixels is equivalent to a starting viewport width of 1280 CSS pixels wide at 400% zoom. 
     For web pages which are designed to scroll horizontally, the 320px should be taken as the height rather than width.</p>
   
   <p class="note">Examples of content which require two-dimensional layout are images, maps, diagrams, 
     video, games, presentations, data tables, and interfaces where it is necessary to keep toolbars in view while
     manipulating content.</p>
