   <p>If the technologies being used allow the <a>user agent</a> to set <a>text</a> <a>style properties</a>, then no loss of content or functionality occurs by setting all of the following and by changing no other style property:</p>
   
   <ul>
     <li>Line height (line spacing) to at least 1.5 times the font size;</li>
     <li>Spacing underneath paragraphs to at least 2 times the font size;</li>
     <li>Letter spacing (tracking) to at least 0.12 times the font size;</li>
     <li>Word spacing to at least 0.16 times the font size.</li>
   </ul>
  
   <p class="ednote">The Working Group seeks examples in the wild of text content outside of <a>blocks of text</a> where it would be impossible to meet this SC. The SC's scope may be narrowed based upon implementation testing.</p>
