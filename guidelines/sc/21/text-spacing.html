   <p class="conformance-level">AA</p>
   					
   <p>In content implemented using markup languages that support the following <a>text</a> <a>style properties</a>, no loss of content or functionality occurs by setting all of the following and by changing no other style property:</p>
   
   <ul>
     <li>Line height (line spacing) to at least 1.5 times the font size;</li>
     <li>Spacing following paragraphs to at least 2 times the font size;</li>
     <li>Letter spacing (tracking) to at least 0.12 times the font size;</li>
     <li>Word spacing to at least 0.16 times the font size.</li>
   </ul>
 
 <p>Exception: Human languages and scripts that do not make use of one or more of these text style properties in written text can conform using only the properties that exist for that combination of language and script.</p>

 <p class="note">It is not required that content use the values specified. The requirement is to ensure no loss of content or functionality when a user overrides the authored styles with the values.</p>
<aside class="note">
<p>Some human languages or writing systems have different needs and may adjust other values (such as paragraph start indent) in order to improve legibility. This success criterion might not be sufficient for those needs. The exception in this SC allows authors to ignore text style properties which are inapplicable to the combination of language and script being used.</p>

<p>It is beneficial for users if authors use any locally available guidance for improving readability in the local language or writing system. If the user chooses to go beyond the metrics specified, any resulting loss of content or functionality is the user's responsibility.</p>
