	<p class="ednote">This Success Criterion is <a href="#further-work">unchanged from the previous Working Draft</a>. The Working Group received comments but was not able to reach consensus on language to address the comments. The Working Group is interested in additional comments on this version of the Success Criterion, or on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/2-2-7_Revision">current non-consensus alternative version</a>. If you have strong views about the output of this discussion, please follow <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag21/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%7Ecomment-interruptions%28minimum%29">discussion in progress on Interruptions (Minimum) issues</a>.</p>
	<p class="ednote">To file comments on this proposal, please <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag21/issues/new">raise new issues</a> for each discrete comment in GitHub.</p> 
  
   <p>A mechanism is <a>easily available</a> to postpone and suppress interruptions and changes in content, unless they
      are initiated by the user or involve an emergency.
