   <p class="ednote">This is a proposed Success Criterion that has not yet been formally approved by the
      Working Group. Discussion of the issue is available in <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag21/issues/67">Issue 67</a>. To file comments on this proposal, please <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag21/issues/new">raise new issues</a> for each discrete comment in GitHub.
   </p>

   <p>All functionality of the content can be operated without requiring specific <a>device sensor</a> information, unless the device sensor is essential for the function and not using
      it would invalidate the activity.

	<p class="ednote">The Working Group has identified questions of scope for this Success Criterion, and is exploring rewording to resolve this. The main question is about the relationship to indirect motion associated with operating a keyboard, pointer, or assistive technology. Draft new wording is available at <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag21/issues/67#issuecomment-325716721">https://github.com/w3c/wcag21/issues/67#issuecomment-325716721</a></p>
