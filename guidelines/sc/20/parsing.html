   <h4>Parsing (Obsolete and removed)</h4>

   <p class="note">This criterion was originally adopted to address problems that Assistive Technology had directly parsing HTML. Assistive Technology no longer has any need to directly parse HTML and, consequently, these problems no longer exist. Accessibility errors failed by this criterion also fail other criteria. This criterion no longer has utility and is removed.</p>
