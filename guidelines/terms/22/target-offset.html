   <p>length of the longest possible line that starts at an edge of a target (A), intersects a second edge of A, and ends at the closest edge of a second target (B). For horizontally aligned targets, target offset is measured with a horizontal line. For vertically aligned targets, target offset is measured with a vertical line. For targets that are neither, target offset is measured diagonally.</p>
   <p>Two targets are horizontally aligned if a horizontal line can be drawn that goes through both targets, but no vertical line can be drawn that goes through both targets. Two targets are vertically aligned if a vertical line can be drawn that goes through both targets, but no horizontal line can be drawn that goes through both targets.</p>
   <p class="note">The target offset from A to B may be different than the target offset from B to A, if the sizes of these targets differ.</p>
