   <p>continuous line forming the boundary of a shape not including shared pixels, or the <a>minimum bounding box</a>, whichever is shortest. For example, the perimeter calculation for a rectangle is 2<em>h</em>+2<em>w</em> -4, where <em>h</em> is the height and <em>w</em> is the width and the corners are not counted twice. The perimeter of a circle is 2𝜋<em>r</em>. For components which wrap onto multiple lines as part of a sentence or block of text (such as links), the perimeter can be established based on how the component would appear on a single line.</p>
