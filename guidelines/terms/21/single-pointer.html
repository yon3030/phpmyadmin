   <p>single <a>pointer input</a>, from a device such as a mouse, or from a <em>single</em> finger or pen on a touchscreen</p>
   <p>Single pointer operations include taps and clicks, double-taps and double-clicks, long presses, swiping, dragging,
      and path-based gestures. In contrast, gestures such as "pinch to zoom" or two-finger swipes are <em>multipoint</em>
      gestures, as they require two or more pointer inputs - in this case, two fingers on a touchscreen.</p>
