	<p>This is in contrast to multi-touch. A pointer can be any point of contact on the screen made by a mouse cursor, pen, touch (including multi-touch), or other pointing input device. This model makes it easier to write sites and applications that work well no matter what hardware the user has. For scenarios when device-specific handling is desired, the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/pointerevents/">Pointer Events</a> [[pointerevents]] specification also defines properties for inspecting.
