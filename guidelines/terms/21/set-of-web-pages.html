   <p>collection of <a>web pages</a> that share a common purpose and that are created by the same author, group or organization
   </p>
   
   <aside class="example"><p>Examples include:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>a publication which is split across multiple Web pages, where each page contains one chapter or other significant section of the work. The publication is logically a single contiguous unit, and contains navigation features that enable access to the full set of pages.</li>
      <li>an e-commerce website showing products is a set of Web pages. When progressing to the checkout process the template changes with the navigation and other elements being removed so the pages in that process are functionally and visually different. The checkout is a separate set of Web pages.</li>
      <li></li>

  <p class="note">Different language versions would be considered different sets of Web pages.</p>
