            <p>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 covers a wide range of recommendations for making Web content more accessible. Following these guidelines will make content accessible to a wider range of people with disabilities, including blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, learning disabilities, cognitive limitations, limited movement, speech disabilities, photosensitivity, and combinations of these. These guidelines address accessibility of web content on desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices. Following these guidelines will also often make your Web content more usable to users in general.</p>
            <p>WCAG 2.1 success criteria are written as testable statements that are not technology-specific. Guidance about satisfying the success criteria in specific technologies, as well as general information about interpreting the success criteria, is provided in separate documents. See <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview</a> for an introduction and links to WCAG technical and educational material.</p>
            <p>WCAG 2.1 extends <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a> [[!WCAG20]], which was published as a W3C Recommendation December 2008. Content that conforms to WCAG 2.1 also conforms to WCAG 2.0, and therefore to policies that reference WCAG 2.0. <!--The W3C recommends that new and updated content use WCAG 2.1 to maximize future applicability of accessibility efforts. The W3C also recommends that new or updated Web accessibility policies reference WCAG 2.1.--></p>
        	<p>Until WCAG 2.1 advances to W3C Recommendation, the current and referenceable document is Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 [[WCAG20]], published as a W3C Recommendation December 2008.</p>

                <h3>About This Draft</h3>
                <p>This is a draft of the guidelines, published to allow initial review of the structure, approach, and types of new success criteria. It does not yet include all the Success Criteria that have been proposed for WCAG 2.1, nor are the ones present necessarily in their final form.</p>
                <p>Because WCAG 2.1 extends WCAG 2.0, all the Success Criteria from WCAG 2.0 are included. To differentiate new Success Criteria, they are labeled as "[New]" and displayed in a <span class="new">green box</span>. In this draft the WCAG 2.0 Success Criteria remain unchanged. This does create some redundancy but the Working Group seeks review of the new Success Criteria at this time and will evaluate where to modify existing WCAG 2.0 Success Criteria later in the process. </p>
                <p>Not all Success Criteria proposals are included in the above list. The Working Group maintains a <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag21/issues/">full set of current Success Criterion proposals</a> which is also available for review and consideration for inclusion in future drafts.</p>

                <h3>Background on WCAG 2</h3>
                <p>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 defines how to make Web content more accessible to people with disabilities. Accessibility involves a wide range of disabilities, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological disabilities. Although these guidelines cover a wide range of issues, they are not able to address the needs of people with all types, degrees, and combinations of disability. These guidelines also make Web content more usable by older individuals with changing abilities due to aging and often improve usability for users in general.</p>
                <p>WCAG 2.1 is developed through the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/w3c-process.php">W3C process</a> in cooperation with individuals and organizations around the world, with a goal of providing a shared standard for Web content accessibility that meets the needs of individuals, organizations, and governments internationally. WCAG 2.1 builds on WCAG 2.0 [[!WCAG20]], which in turn built on WCAG 1.0 [[WAI-WEBCONTENT]] and is designed to apply broadly to different Web technologies now and in the future, and to be testable with a combination of automated testing and human evaluation. For an introduction to WCAG, see the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview</a>.</p>
                <p>Web accessibility depends not only on accessible content but also on accessible Web browsers and other user agents. Authoring tools also have an important role in Web accessibility. For an overview of how these components of Web development and interaction work together, see:</p>

                </ul>
                <p>Further introductory information about the structure of WCAG 2.0, inherited by WCAG 2.1, is available in the introduction to WCAG 2.0. For brevity in this draft it is not repeated here but can be found at:</p>

                <h3>Conformance to WCAG 2.1</h3>
                <p>WCAG 2.1 uses the same conformance model as WCAG 2.0, which is described in the <a href="#conformance">Conformance</a> section. The conformance section has not been updated in this Working Draft to describe how WCAG 2.1 conformance builds upon WCAG 2.0 conformance. In particular, it is intended that sites that conform to WCAG 2.1 also conform to WCAG 2.0, which means they meet the requirements of any policies that reference WCAG 2.0, while also better meeting the needs of users on the current Web. Conformance wording for this will be provided in a future Working Draft.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Future work on WCAG 2.1</h3>
                <p>The Accessibility Guidelines Working Group plans to continue developing WCAG 2.1 over the course of 2017. This work will primarily involve review and processing of the Success Criteria proposals, response to public feedback on this and later Working Drafts, and preparation of support materials similar to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/">Understanding WCAG 2.0</a> [[UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20]] and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/">Techniques for WCAG 2.0</a> [[WCAG20-TECHS]]. Early feedback on this work as soon as it is available is important, because the Working Group intends to begin finalization stages towards the end of the year.</p>
                <p>Once the set of Success Criteria has been decided for WCAG 2.1, the Working Group will review the structure of the document. One goal will be to achieve the most clear backwards compatibility possible with WCAG 2.0; another will be to optimize the new Success Criteria to reduce duplication and increase clarity. The Working Group will also make final decisions about characteristics of the specification such as numbering and position of added Success Criteria. In preparation for the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#candidate-rec">Candidate Recommendation</a>, the Working Group will also re-evaluate testability and implementability of the Success Criteria given the technologies available at that time.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Later versions of Accessibility Guidelines</h3>
                <p>In parallel with WCAG 2.1, the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group is working on requirements for a 3.0 version of accessibility guidelines, developed by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/silver/">Silver Task Force</a>. The result of this work is expected to be a more substantial restructuring of web accessibility guidance than would be realistic for dot-releases of WCAG 2. The task force follows a research-focused, user-centered design methodology to produce the most effective and flexible outcome, including the roles of content authoring, user agent support, and authoring tool support. This is a multi-year effort, so WCAG 2.1 is needed as an interim measure to provide updated web accessibility guidance to reflect changes on the web since the publication of WCAG 2.0.</p>
                <p>In order for WCAG 2.1 to achieve its goal to update web accessibility guidance in a time frame that is meaningful before the 3.0 project delivers results, WCAG 2.1 must be completed quickly. This inherently means that some proposed Success Criteria may prove too complex to include in WCAG 2.1, but nonetheless will be viewed as important accessibility guidance for current web content. The larger 3.0 project is expected to incorporate such guidance, but the Working Group could also decide that another set of guidelines between WCAG 2.1 and 3.0 is needed. In that case, a new version, WCAG 2.2, could be proposed. A decision to develop WCAG 2.2 will need to balance the benefits of providing additional accessibility guidance earlier, versus the opportunity cost the work could have on the more substantially restructured and comprehensive 3.0 project. The current <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/01/ag-charter">Accessibility Guidelines Working Group charter</a> states "The Working Group intends to produce updated guidance for accessibility on a regular interval, starting with WCAG 2.1. Depending on the outcome of the requirements development for the next major update to WCAG, it may be necessary to pursue further dot-releases of WCAG until a major release is ready to be completed in time for a scheduled release date."</p>

            <p>This section lists requirements for <a>conformance</a> to WCAG 2.1. It also gives information about how to make conformance claims, which are optional. Finally, it describes what it means to be <a>accessibility supported</a>, since only accessibility-supported ways of using technologies can be <a>relied upon</a> for conformance. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/conformance">Understanding Conformance</a> includes further explanation of the accessibility-supported concept.</p>

                <h2>Conformance Requirements</h2>
                <p>In order for a Web page to conform to WCAG 2.1, all of the following conformance requirements must be satisfied:</p>

                <section id="cc1">
                    <h3>Conformance Level</h3>
                    <p>One of the following levels of conformance is met in full.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For Level A conformance (the minimum level of conformance), the <a>Web page</a>
                            <a>satisfies</a> all the Level A Success Criteria, or a <a>conforming alternate version</a> is provided.</li>
                        <li>For Level AA conformance, the Web page satisfies all the Level A and Level AA Success Criteria, or a Level AA conforming alternate version is provided.</li>
                        <li>For Level AAA conformance, the Web page satisfies all the Level A, Level AA and Level AAA Success Criteria, or a Level AAA conforming alternate version is provided.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Although conformance can only be achieved at the stated levels, authors are encouraged to report (in their claim) any progress toward meeting success criteria from all levels beyond the achieved level of conformance.</p>
                    <p>It is not recommended that Level AAA conformance be required as a general policy for entire sites because it is not possible to satisfy all Level AAA Success Criteria for some content.</p>

                <section id="cc2">
                    <h3>Full pages</h3>
                    <p><a>Conformance</a> (and conformance level) is for full <a>Web page(s)</a> only, and cannot be achieved if part of a Web page is excluded.</p>
                    <p class="note">For the purpose of determining conformance, alternatives to part of a page's content are considered part of the page when the alternatives can be obtained directly from the page, e.g., a long description or an alternative presentation of a video.</p>

(Conformance is not possible at a particular level if any page in the process does not conform at that level or better.)</p>
                    <p>An online store has a series of pages that are used to select and purchase products. All pages in the series from start to finish (checkout) conform in order for any page that is part of the process to conform.</p>

                    </ol>
                    <p>In addition, the following success criteria apply to all content on the page, including content that is not otherwise relied upon to meet conformance, because failure to meet them could interfere with any use of the page:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>1.4.2 - Audio Control</strong>,</li>

                <h2>Statement of Partial Conformance - Third Party Content</h2>
                <p>Sometimes, Web pages are created that will later have additional content added to them. For example, an email program, a blog, an article that allows users to add comments, or applications supporting user-contributed content. Another example would be a page, such as a portal or news site, composed of content aggregated from multiple contributors, or sites that automatically insert content from other sources over time, such as when advertisements are inserted dynamically.</p>
                <p>In these cases, it is not possible to know at the time of original posting what the uncontrolled content of the pages will be. It is important to note that the uncontrolled content can affect the accessibility of the controlled content as well. Two options are available:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>A determination of conformance can be made based on best knowledge. If a page of this type is monitored and repaired (non-conforming content is removed or brought into conformance) within two business days, then a determination or claim of conformance can be made since, except for errors in externally contributed content which are corrected or removed when encountered, the page conforms. No conformance claim can be made if it is not possible to monitor or correct non-conforming content;</p>
                        <p><strong>OR</strong></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>A "statement of partial conformance" may be made that the page does not conform, but could conform if certain parts were removed. The form of that statement would be, "This page does not conform, but would conform to WCAG 2.1 at level X if the following parts from uncontrolled sources were removed." In addition, the following would also be true of uncontrolled content that is described in the statement of partial conformance:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>It is not content that is under the author's control.</li>
                            <li>It is described in a way that users can identify (e.g., they cannot be described as "all parts that we do not control" unless they are clearly marked as such.)</li>
                        </ol>
