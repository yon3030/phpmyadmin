			<h2>When to Use</h2>
			<h3>Applicability</h3>
			<p>The Technique is applicable to any technology that supports the display of additional content on pointer hover.</p>
		</section>
    
		<section id="description">
			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>The objective of this failure is to describe a situation where users find it difficult or impossible to move the pointer over pop-up content that has opened on hover or focus. For users of screen magnification software, the new pop-up content is often not fully visible in the current magnifed section. In order to perceive it, it is therefore critical for these users to be able to move the pointer away from the trigger and over the popup content, and thereby change the position of the magnified section, without this content disappearing.</p>
		</section>
    
		<section id="examples">
			<h2>Examples</h2>
<ul>
	<li>A pop-up opens on pointer hover and when the trigger receives keyboard focus. Due to the chosen screen magnification, the content is only partially visible. However, as soon as the pointer is moved away from the trigger towards the pop-up content so it can be read, the pop-up automatically closes.</li>
 <li>Hovering over a chart with datapoints, pop-ups open to show details of the respective data point, somewhat offset from the datapoint itself. When moving the pointer towards the pop-up so it can be fully read with magnificaton, the pointer travels over other data points that cause the appearance of other pop-ups that replace the particular pop-up the user wanted to see.</li>

				<h3>Procedure</h3>
        <p>For each area of pop-up content that appears from a hover or focus event check whether:</p>
				<ol>
    <li>The pointer can be moved over the full area of the pop-up without the pop-up disappearing.</li>

				<h3>Expected Results</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>If #1 is false, then content fails the Success Criterion.</li>
