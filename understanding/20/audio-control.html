      <h2>Intent of Audio Control</h2>
      
      
      <p>Individuals who use screen reading software can find it hard to hear the speech output
         if there is other audio playing at the same time. This difficulty is exacerbated when
         the screen reader's speech output is software based (as most are today) and is controlled
         via the same volume control as the sound. Therefore, it is important that the user
         be able to turn off the background sound. Note: Having control of the volume includes
         being able to reduce its volume to zero.
      </p>
      
      <div class="note">
         
         <p>Playing audio automatically when landing on a page may affect a screen reader user's
            ability to find the mechanism to stop it because they navigate by listening and automatically
            started sounds might interfere with that navigation. Therefore, we discourage the
            practice of automatically starting sounds (especially if they last more than 3 seconds),
            and encourage that the sound be 
            <em>started</em> by an action initiated by the user after they reach the page, rather than requiring
            that the sound be 
            <em>stopped</em> by an action of the user after they land on the page.

         <h3>Benefits of Audio Control</h3>
         
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>Individuals who use screen reading technologies can hear the screen reader without
               other sounds playing. This is especially important for those who are hard of hearing
               and for those whose screen readers use the system volume (so they cannot turn sound
               down and screen reader up).
            </li>
            
            <li>This Success Criterion also benefits people who have difficulty focusing on visual
               content (including text) when audio is playing.

      <h2>Examples of Audio Control</h2>
      
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>An audio file begins playing automatically when a page is opened. However, the audio
            can be stopped by the user by selecting a "silent" link at the top of the page.
         </li>
         
         <li>
            A Flash splash page with sound that plays and then stops in less than 3 seconds.
            
            
            
         </li>
         
         <li>
            A Flash splash page with sound that plays automatically includes a control at the
            top that allows users to turn the sound off.
