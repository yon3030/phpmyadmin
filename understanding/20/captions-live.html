      <h2>Intent of Captions (Live)</h2>
      
      
      <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to enable people who are deaf or hard of hearing
         to watch 
         <em>real-time</em> presentations. Captions provide the part of the content available via the audio track.
         Captions not only include dialogue, but also identify who is speaking and notate sound
         effects and other significant audio.
      </p>
      
      <p>This success criterion was intended to apply to broadcast of synchronized media and
         is not intended to require that two-way multimedia calls between two or more individuals
         through web apps must be captioned regardless of the needs of users. Responsibility
         for providing captions would fall to the content providers (the callers) or the “host”
         caller, and not the application.

            <p>An orchestra provides Communication Access Realtime Translation (CART) captioning
               of each real-time Web performance. The CART service captures lyrics and dialog as
               well as identifies non-vocal music by title, movement, composer, and any information
               that will help the user comprehend the nature of the audio.
