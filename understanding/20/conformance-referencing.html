      <h2>When referring to WCAG 2.0 from another standard with a "should" statement</h2>
      				
      <p>When referencing WCAG 2.0 from within a 
         <strong>should</strong> statement in a standard (or advisory statement in a regulation), then the full WCAG
         2.0 should be referenced. This would mean that all three levels of WCAG 2.0 should
         be considered but that none are required. The format for referencing WCAG 2.0 from
         a "should" statement therefore, is:

      <h2>When referring to WCAG 2.0 from another standard with a "shall or must" statement</h2>
      
      <p>When citing WCAG 2.0 as part of a requirement (e.g., a 
         <strong>shall or must
            
         </strong> statement in a standard or regulation), the reference must include the specific parts
         of WCAG 2.0 that are intended to be required. When referencing WCAG 2.0 in this manner,
         the following rules apply: 
         
      </p>
      				
      <ol>
         					
         <li>Conformance at any level of WCAG 2.0 requires that all of the Level A Success Criteria
            be met. References to WCAG 2.0 conformance cannot be for any subset of Level A.
            
         </li>
         					
         <li>Beyond Level A, a "shall or must" reference may include any subset of provisions in
            Levels AA and AAA. For example, "
            <em>all of Level A and [some specific list of Success Criteria in Level AA and Level AAA]</em>" be met.
            
         </li>
         					
         <li>If Level AA conformance to WCAG 2.0 is specified, then all Level A and all Level AA
            Success Criteria must be met.
         </li>
         					
         <li>
            						
            <p>If Level AAA conformance to WCAG 2.0 is specified, then all Level A, all Level AA,
               and all Level AAA Success Criteria must be met.
            </p>
            						
            <div class="note">
               							
               <p>It is not recommended that Level AAA conformance ever be required for entire sites
                  as a general policy because it is not possible to satisfy all Level AAA Success Criteria
                  for some content. 
                  
               </p>
               							
               <p>The sets of Success Criteria defined in WCAG are interdependent and individual Success
                  Criteria rely on each other's definitions in ways which may not be immediately obvious
                  to the reader. Any set of Success Criteria must include all of the Level A provisions.

      <p>Techniques, which are listed in Understanding WCAG 2.0 and described in other supporting
         documents, are not part of the normative WCAG 2.0 Recommendation and should not be

         in support documents should be cited separately.

      <p>Techniques can be cited based on the individual Technique document or on the master
