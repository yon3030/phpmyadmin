      <h2>Intent of Headings and Labels</h2>
      
      
      <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to help users understand what information
         is contained in Web pages and how that information is organized. When headings are
         clear and descriptive, users can find the information they seek more easily, and they
         can understand the relationships between different parts of the content more easily.
         Descriptive labels help users identify specific components within the content.
      </p>
      
      <p>Labels and headings do not need to be lengthy. A word, or even a single character,
         may suffice if it provides an appropriate cue to finding and navigating content.
      </p>
      
      <div class="note">
         
         <p>This success criterion does not require headings or labels. This success criterion
            requires that if headings or labels are provided, they be descriptive. Also note that,
            if headings or labels are provided, they must meet 
            <a href="info-and-relationships">1.3.1: Info and Relationships</a>.

      <h2>Benefits of Headings and Labels</h2>
      
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>Descriptive headings are especially helpful for users who have disabilities that make
            reading slow and for people with limited short-term memory. These people benefit when
            section titles make it possible to predict what each section contains.
         </li>
         
         <li>People who have difficulty using their hands or who experience pain when doing so
            will benefit from techniques that reduce the number of keystrokes required to reach
            the content they need.
         </li>
         
         <li>
            
            <p>This Success Criterion helps people who use screen readers by ensuring that labels
               and headings are meaningful when read out of context, for example, in a Table of Contents,
               or when jumping from heading to heading within a page.
            </p>
            
            <p>This Success Criterion may also help users with low vision who can see only a few
               words at a time.

            </p>
            
            <p>The home page of a news site lists the headlines for the top stories of the hour.
               Under each heading are the first 35 words of the story and a link to the full article.
               Each headline gives a clear idea of the article's subject.

            </p>
            
            <p>A guide on writing contains the following section titles: How To Write Well,  Cut
               Out Useless Words,   Identify Unnecessary Words, etc.  The section headings are clear
               and concise and the structure of the information is reflected in the structure of
               the headings.

            <p>A Web site contains papers from a conference. Submissions to the conference are required
               to have the following organization: Summary, Introduction, [other sections unique
               to this article], Conclusion, Author Biography, Glossary, and Bibliography. The title
               of each Web page clearly identifies the article it contains, creating a useful balance
               between the uniqueness of the articles and the consistency of the section headings.
