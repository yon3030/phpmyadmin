      <h2>Intent of Keyboard Accessible</h2>
      
      
      <p>If all 
         <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#functiondef">functionality</a> can be achieved using the keyboard, it can be accomplished by keyboard users, by
         speech input (which creates keyboard input), by mouse (using on-screen keyboards),
         and by a wide variety of assistive technologies that create simulated keystrokes as
         their output. No other input form has this flexibility or is universally supported
         and operable by people with different disabilities, as long as the keyboard input
         is not time-dependent.
      </p>
      
      <p>Note that providing universal keyboard input does not mean that other types of input
         should not be supported. Optimized speech input, optimized mouse/pointer input, etc.,
         are also good. The key is to provide keyboard input and control as well.
      </p>
      
      <p>Some devices do not have native keyboardsâ€”for example, a PDA or cell phone. If these
         devices have a Web browsing capability, however, they will have some means of generating
         text or "keystrokes". This guideline uses the term "
         <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#keybrd-interfacedef">keyboard interface</a>" to acknowledge that Web content should be controlled from keystrokes that may come
         from a keyboard, keyboard emulator, or other hardware or software that generates keyboard
         or text input.
