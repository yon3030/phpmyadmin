		<h1>Understanding Label in Name</h1>
		<section id="intent">
			<h2>Intent</h2>
			<p>Webpage controls often have visible text labels. Controls also have a programmatic label, it’s Accessible Name ((This needs a link to a definition))]. Some types of users have a much better experience if the visible text labels of controls match their Accessible Names.</p>
			<p>Speech input users can navigate webpages by speaking the visible text labels of menus, links and button labels that appear on a webpage. It’s confusing to speech input users when they say a visible text label they see but the speech does not work because the accessible name is enabled as a speech input command but does not match the visible label.</p>
			<p>An Accessible Name that is different from the visible label is also a hidden command for speech input users, and can be accidentally activated without the user knowing what has happened.</p>
			<p>Text-to-speech users will also have a better experience if the text they hear matches the text they see on the screen.</p> 
			<p>This issue is even more important for speech input and text-to-speech users who also have cognitive challenges. It’s an extra cognitive load for a speech input user to remember and say a speech command that is different from the visible label on a control. It’s an extra cognitive load for a text-to-speech user to absorb and understand speech output that does not match the visible label.</p>
