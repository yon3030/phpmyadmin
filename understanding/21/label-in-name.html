		<h1>Understanding Label in Name</h1>
		<section id="intent">
			<h2>Intent</h2>
			<p>Webpages often have visible text labels. Visible text labels also have Accessible Names. Some types of users have a much better experience if visible text labels match Accessible Names.</p>
			<p>Speech input users can navigate webpages by speaking the visible text labels of menus, links and button labels that appear on a webpage. It’s confusing to speech input users when they say a visible text label they see and the command does not work because the accessible name is enabled  as a command but does not match the visible label.</p>
			<p>An Accessible Name that is different from the visible label acts like a hidden command for speech input users.</p>
			<p>Text-to-speech users will also have a better experience if the text they hear matches the text they see on the screen.</p> 
			<p>This issue is even more important for Speech input and text-to-speech users who also have cognitive challenges. Remembering a speech command that does not match a visible label increases cognitive load. Parsing text output that does not match the visible label also increases cognitive load.</p>
			<p>Note that if an icon has no accompanying text its visible label is its hover text.</p>
