		<h1>Understanding Label in Name</h1>
		<section id="intent">
			<h2>Intent</h2>
			<p>Some users rely on speech recognition to control the computer. Speech users can navigate webpages by speaking visible labels of menus, links and button labels that appear on a webpage. But mismatched labels can confuse speech input users when they say the visible label they see but it does not match the Accessible Name, which is what is enabled as a command.</p>
<p>Speech input programs also sometimes enable users to speak labels that aren't visible on the page. Speech users can accidentally say a word in a hidden label and be taken to that link without knowing what has happened. Hidden commands aren't usually problematic for other means of input. But if speech users pause before and after a group of words that makes up a command, the speech input engine returns the command, not the words. This is the way speech engines generally work and it generally works well. But if a webpage contains many hidden, extra commands, it becomes easy to unexpectedly click a hidden command. When this happens it can be difficult for users to tell what happened. They can unwittingly click a link, making the current page seemingly disappear. If the user manages to get back to that page sometimes text they've entered is gone. Delineating the visible label portion of the invisible label would give speech engines a way to address this issue.</p>
