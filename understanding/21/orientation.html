		<h1>Understanding Orientation</h1>
		<section id="intent">
			<h2>Intent</h2>
			<p>Some websites and applications automatically set the screen to a particular display orientation (landscape or portrait) and expect
			that users will respond by rotating their device to match. However, some users have their devices mounted
			in a fixed orientation (e.g. on the arm of a power wheelchair). Therefore, websites and applications need to support both orientations
			by making sure content and functionality is available in each orientation. While the order of content and method of functionality
			may have differences the content and functionality is available. When a particular orientation is essential, the user
			needs to be advised of the orientation requirements.</p>
			<section id="benefits">
				<h3>Benefits</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Users with dexterity impairments, who have a mounted device will be able to use the content in their fixed orientation</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
		</section>
		<section id="examples">
			<h2>Examples</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Example 1: Online video site</strong><br>
				Videos are not locked to a specific orientation.  A user can start a video with their device in a portrait orientation resulting in a smaller video being displayed and then rotate the device to landscape and have the video expand to fill the entire screen.  All controls and functionality are still available in the landscape orientation.</li>
				<li><strong>Example 2: Messaging website</strong><br>
				A messaging website can display messages in both portrait and landscape orientations without a loss of content or functionality. </li>
				<li><strong>Example 3: eReader web app</strong><br>
				An eReader web app can display the contents of a book in both portrait and landscape mode without a loss of conent or functionality</li>
				<li><strong>Example 4: Check deposit in banking app</strong><br>
				An example where orientation is essential could be a banking app that requires the device be in landscape mode to easily and accurately capture an image of a check for deposit.</li>
				<li><strong>Example 5: Piano app</strong><br>
				An example where orientation is essential could be a piano app that requires the device to be in landscape mode to allow enough room for all of the piano keys to be accessible and usable.</li>

				<p>Each numbered item in this section represents a technique or combination of techniques that the <acronym title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</acronym> Working Group deems sufficient for meeting this Success Criterion. However, it is not necessary to use these particular techniques. For information on using other techniques, see <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2016/NOTE-UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20-20161007/understanding-techniques.html">Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria</a>, particularly the "Other Techniques" section. </p>
			</div>
			<section id="sufficient">
				<h3>Sufficient</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Using CSS to set the orientation to allow both landscape and portrait.</li>
					<li>Use of show/hide controls to allow access to content in different orientations.</li>
					<li>Use of the flexible box model to change the meaningful sequence order of content to match the visual order in different orientations.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section id="failure">
				<h2>Failure</h2>
			   <ul>
					<li>Locking the orientation.</li>
					<li>Functionality that is only available in one orientation.</li>
