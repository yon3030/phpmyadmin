		</h1>
		<section id="intent">
			<h2>Intent of this Success Criterion</h2>
			<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that content displays in the orientation (portrait or landscape) preferred by the user. Some websites and applications automatically set and lock the screen to a particular display orientation and expect
			that users will respond by rotating their device to match. However, some users have their devices mounted
			in a fixed orientation (e.g. on the arm of a power wheelchair). Therefore, websites and applications need to support both orientations
			by not locking the orientation. Changes in content or functionality due to the size of display are not covered by this criteria which is focused on restrictions of orientation.</p>
			<section id="benefits">
				<h3>Benefits</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Users with dexterity impairments, who have a mounted device will be able to use the content in their fixed orientation.</li>
					<li>Users with low-vision will be able to view content in the orientation that works best for them, for example to increase the text size by viewing content in landscape.</li>
				</ul>

			<h2>Examples</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Example 1: Online video site</strong><br />
				Videos are not locked to a specific orientation.  A user can start a video with their device in a portrait or in landscape orientation.</li>
				<li><strong>Example 2: Messaging website</strong><br />
				A messaging website can display messages in both portrait and landscape orientations. </li>
				<li><strong>Example 3: eReader web app</strong><br />
				An eReader web app can display the contents of a book in both portrait and landscape orientation.</li>
				<li><strong>Example 4: Check deposit in banking app</strong><br />
				An example where orientation is essential could be a banking app that requires the device be in landscape mode to easily and accurately capture an image of a check for deposit. These paper forms are typically about twice as wide as they are high.</li>
				<li><strong>Example 5: Piano app</strong><br />
				An example where orientation is essential could be a piano app that requires the device to be in landscape mode to allow room for enough of the piano keys to be functionally usable. Since a piano app is emulating a physical piano keyboard that needs to retain relative physical characteristics between keys, either too few keys would be available, or the keys would be much too narrow.</li>
