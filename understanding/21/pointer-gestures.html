    <h1><strong>Pointer Gestures</strong><br />Understanding SC 2.5.1</h1>
    <p class="sctext"><strong>2.5.1 Pointer Gestures:</strong> All functionality which uses multipoint or timed gestures for operation can be operated with an untimed single-pointer activation, unless a multipoint or timed gesture is essential.</p>
		<section id="intent">
			<h2>Intent of this Success Criterion</h2>
			<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that, wherever possible, content can be operated through simple and untimed pointer input gestures. This includes, but is not limited to, input via touch on touchscreens, mouse pointer input, pencil input, or laser pointer input.</p>
      <p>The success criterion applies to author-created gestures, as opposed to gestures defined on the level of operating systems or user agents. An example for gestures provided on the operating system level would be gestures for built-in assistive technologies (AT) to focus or activate content, or to call up AT menus. An example of user agent-implemented gestures would be vertical swiping implemented by browsers for scrolling longer pages.</p>
        <p>Some users cannot perform complex and timed pointer gestures (e.g. a swipe gesture, the drawing of a complex path on the screen, or a long press) in a precise manner - they may lack the accuracy or speed necessary to carry it out. Further, it may not always be possible for users to perform multi-pointer gestures (for example, a two-finger pinch zoom, a split tap, or a three finger swipe). Authors must therefore ensure that their content can be operated without requiring the user to perform timed or complex gestures.</p>
      
      <p>While an OS may provide ways to define "macros" for common gestures, this option is not pervasive on all touch-enabled platforms. Moreover, this may work for standard gestures that a user can predefine, but won't work for arbitrary gestures.</p>

      <p>Note: The Success Criterion  does not preclude or discourage the inclusion of gesture-based interactions; however, if gesture-based operation is supported, then an alternative which only requires a single untimed gesture (such as a mouse click or a tap on the screen) or a series of such gestures must be present.</p>
			<section id="benefits">
				<h3>Benefits</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><p>Users who cannot (accurately) perform complex or timed pointer gestures will be able to operate the content.</p></li>
          <li><p>The availability of user interface elements provided as a fallback for complex and timed gestures helps users who may be unaware of the support for complex or timed pointer gestures. This can be beneficial especially for users with cognitive or learning disabilities.</p></li>
				</ul>

		<section id="examples">
			<h2>Examples</h2>
				<ul>
        <li><p>A web application that includes a map view supports the pinch gesture to zoom into the map content, and drag gestures to move the visible area. User interface controls offer the operation via [+] and [-] buttons to zoom in and out, and arrow buttons to pan stepwise in all directions.</p></li>
        <li><p>A news site has a carousel slider with different news teasers that can be browsed via horizontal swipes. It also has arrow buttons to browse carousel items forward or backward.</p></li>

			<h2>Techniques for  SC 2.5.1 - Pointer Gestures</h2>    
				<h3>Sufficient Techniques</h3>			
       <ul>
         <li><p>GXXX: Do not rely solely on complex pointer gestures that require high precision or specific timings</p></li>
         <li><p>GXXX: Do not rely on multi-pointer gestures</p></li>
         <li><p>GXXX: Provide controls that do not require complex gestures and perform the same function as a complex gesture</p></li>
       </ul>

<p>[Note: the techniques M3 and M9 are related and may be combined in 2.1. M3 requires that functionality work without timing or multi gestures, M9 requires it works without tilt, specific pressure, or angle, etc...]</p>

				<h2>Failure</h2>
				<ul>
          <li>Pointer gestures rely solely on complex ponter gestures that require high precision and specific timings</li>
          <li>Pointer gesture can only be one using multi-pointer gesture</li>
