    <h1><strong>Pointer Gestures</strong><br />Understanding SC 2.5.1</h1>
    
		<section id="intent">
			<h2>Intent of this Success Criterion</h2>
			<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that content can be controlled with a range of pointing devices, abilities, and assistive technologies. Some people  cannot perform gestures in a precise manner, or they may use a specialized or adapted input device such as a head pointer, eye-gaze system, or speech-controlled mouse emulator. Some pointing methods lack the capability or accuracy to perform multipoint or path-based gestures.</p>

			<p>A <strong>path-based gesture</strong> involves an interaction where the user engages a pointer (starting point), carries out a movement that goes through at least one mid-point before disengaging the pointer (end point). The mid-point defines the path as a gesture.</p>

			<figure>

				<figcaption>A path-based gesture involves starting a pointer movement that goes through at least one mid-point before the end-point. The end-point may be a continuation, or allow for various movements.</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>Examples of path-based gestures include swiping, some sliders and carousels, and other gestures which trace a prescribed path such as the drawing a specific shape. Such paths may be drawn with a finger or stylus on a touchscreen, graphics tablet, or trackpad, or with a mouse, joystick, or similar pointer device.</p>

			<p class="note">Any path-based movement of a pointer could be difficult or impossible to use for someone who cannot perform precise movements, therefore alternative forms of interaction are always recommended. Path-based gestures are used by the success criteria as it may be difficult or impossible to provide an alternative for free-form paths.</p>

			<p>Examples of <strong>multipoint</strong> gestures include a two-finger pinch zoom, a split tap where one finger rests on the screen and a second finger taps, or a two- or three-finger tap or swipe. A user may find it difficult or impossible to accomplish these if they type and point with a single finger or stick, in addition to any of the causes listed above.</p>

			<p>Authors must ensure that their content can be operated without multipoint or path-based gestures. Multipoint or path-based gestures can be used so long as the functionality can also be operated by another method, such as a tap, click, double tap, double click, long press, and click &amp; hold. </p>

			<p>This Success Criterion applies to author-created gestures, as opposed to gestures defined on the level of operating system or user agent. Examples for gestures provided at the operating system level would be swiping down to see system notifications, and gestures for built-in assistive technologies (AT) to focus or activate content, or to call up AT menus. Examples of user-agent-implemented gestures would be horizontal swiping implemented by browsers for navigating within the page history, or vertical swiping to scroll page content.</p>

			<p>While some operating systems may provide ways to define "macros" to replace complex gestures, content authors cannot rely on such a capability because it is not pervasive on all touch-enabled platforms. Moreover, this may work for standard gestures that a user can predefine, but may not work for other author-defined gestures.</p>
			
			<p>This Success Criterion does not require all functionality to be available through pointing devices, but that which is must be available to users who use the pointing device but cannot perform complex gestures. While content authors may provide keyboard commands or other non-pointer mechanisms that perform actions equivalent to complex gestures (see Success Criterion 2.1.1 Keyboard), this is not sufficient to conform to this Success Criterion. That is because some users rely entirely on pointing devices, or find simple pointer inputs much easier than alternatives. For example, a user relying on a head-pointer would find clicking a control to be much more convenient than activating an on-screen keyboard to emulate a keyboard shortcut, and a person who has difficulty memorizing a series of keys (or gestures) may find it much easier to simply click on a labeled control. Therefore, if one or more pointer-based mechanisms are supported, then their benefits should be afforded to users through simple, single-point actions alone.</p>

      <p>An exception is made for functionality that is inherently and necessarily based on complex paths or multipoint gestures. For example, entering one's signature may be inherently path-based (although acknowledging something or confirming one's identity need not be).</p>

      <p>Gestures that involve dragging in any direction are not in scope for this SC, however, such gestures do require fine motor control. Authors are encouraged to provide non-dragging methods, for instance, a drag and drop operation could also be achieved by selecting an item (with a tap or keyboard interaction) and then selecting its destination as a second step.</p>
      
			<section id="benefits">
				<h3>Benefits</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><p>Users who cannot (accurately) perform complex pointer gestures will have alternative means for operating the content.</p></li>
          <li><p>The availability of user interface elements provided as a fallback for complex gestures helps users who may often be unaware of the support for complex pointer gestures. This can be beneficial especially for users with cognitive or learning disabilities.</p></li>
				</ul>

			<h2>Examples</h2>
				<ul>
        <li><p>A web site includes a map view that supports the pinch gesture to zoom into the map content. User interface controls offer the operation via [+] and [-] buttons to zoom in and out.</p></li>
        <li><p>A news site has a horizontal content slider with hidden news teasers that can moved into the viewport via horizontal swiping. It also offers forward and backward arrow buttons for single-point activation to navigate to adjacent slider content.</p></li>
				<li><p>A kanban widget with several vertical areas representing states in a defined process allows the user to right- or left-swipe elements to move them to an adjacent silo. The user can also accomplish this by selecting the element with a single tap or click, and then activating an arrow button to move the selected element.</p></li>
				<li><p>A custom slider requires movement in a strict left/right direction when operated by dragging the thumb control. Buttons on both sides of the slider increment and decrement the selected value and update the thumb position.</p></li>
      </ul>
