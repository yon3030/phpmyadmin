			<h2>Intent of Additional Sensor Inputs</h2>
       <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that web content does not interfere with sensor input while providing a fallback to other means of input where appropriate.</p>
      <p>Where sensor input is used to accommodate web content to the context of use, such as adapting it to the current display orientation, authors should not restrict or prevent such accommodation, or provide explicit choice to the user. Where sensor input such as deliberate motion of the device or person is supported by authors as a means of actuation, web content should provide alternative means of actuation, such as interface controls that accept input via a keyboard interface or pointer.</p>
      <p>The focus of this guideline is on sensor information related to handling the device itself (e.g., when turning, inclining or shaking it) or motioning while being exposed to its sensors (such as performing gestures that are interpreted by the camera, proximity sensors, or depth sensors). Other device sensors exist that are not suitable or not intended to be used as a means of user actuation, such as temperature, pressure, or ambient light sensors. For these sensors, alternative means of input are not meaningful and not required.</p>

			<h3>Benefits of Additional Sensor Inputs</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>People can use web content in their preferred orientation. On small devices, it can be important to use a landscape orientation to improve the readability especially of enlarged text, or reduce the need for horizontal scrolling or panning when viewing content that exceeds the viewport dimensions.</li>
         <li>When people are unable to use motion to actuate web content via device sensors, they will find interface controls as alternative means of actuation, e.g. via the keyboard interface and related input devices such as a physical keyboard, voice or switch input, or via pointer input.</li>
      </ul>
