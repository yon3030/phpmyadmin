		<h1>Understanding Identify Input Purpose</h1>
		<section id="intent">
			<h2>Intent</h2>
	  
			<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to help people recognize and understand the purpose of form input fields. When people fill in a web form, they are usually expected to provide information about themselves in various fields. Examples are first name, family name, street adress, postal code, username, or credit card details. Specifying what kind of data is expected in a particular field makes filling out forms easier, especially for people with cognitive disabilities. 
        <p>Currently a well-supported way of identifying input purpose is using the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/sec-forms.html#sec-autofill">autocomplete values from HTML5.2</a>. For fields with autocomplete values set, the browser can suggest and 'autofill' the right content by autocompleting these fields based on past user input stored in the browser. The user is relieved of having to type the information, and can instead confirm or - if needed - change the value of the field.</p>
        
       <p>For some input fields, the type attribute already offers a way to specify the purpose, for example, input type="tel", input type="email", or input type="password". The HTML autocomplete attribute allows a more fine-grained identification of purpose than the type attribute, for example, by allowing the author to specify whether a password is a current password (autocomplete="current-password") or a newly selected password intended to replace the current password (autocomplete="new-password").</p>
         
      <p>In addition to helping user agents provide the appropriate autofill behavior, the autocomplete values may also be used by assistive technologies to customise the presentation of input fields to users. For example, assisitive technologies may display familiar icons next to input fields to help users who have difficulties reading. An icon of a person may be shown in front of an input field with autocomplete="name", or the icon of a telephone in front of an input field with autocomplete="tel".</p>
       <p>When the user agent and asssitive technology support for other metadata formats matures, metadata schemes like the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/personalization-semantics/content/">Personalization Semantics Content Module</a> may be used in addition or instead of the HTML autocomplete attribute to identify the purpose of input fields. These metadata need not be limited to input fields and can provide a richer context for interface personalization automated adaptations, for example for identifying and matching author-provided names of inputs to more familiar terms or symbols for labelling these inputs.</p>

			<p><strong>Providing the autocomplete attribute on suitable inputs</strong> - these techniques work on all the specified fields.</p>

			<p>The list of values that should be used are available in the HTML5 specification: <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/sec-forms.html#sec-autofill">autocomplete values from HTML5.2</a>.</p>
