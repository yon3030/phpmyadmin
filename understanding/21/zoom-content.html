		<h1>Understanding Zoom Content</h1>
		<section id="intent">
		  <h2>Intent</h2>
		  <p>The intent is to allow  the browser zoom function to zoom content to 400% without requiring scrolling in the direction of the text. For western languages, zooming page content will not require horizontal scrolling.  Goal: Authors to responsively support the resizing and reflow of content as allowed by the browser. </p>
			<p>Zoom functionality in browsers allows users to increase the size of all content. When appropriately authored, the content can reflow (wrap) to stay within the windows boundaries (viewport). Spatial relationships can vary, but all content and functionality continues to be available.</p>
			<p>The size 400% was picked as the largest size a standard website can currently get to using responsive design. If the user needs to increase content more than 400%, then a complete <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/low-vision-a11y-tf/wiki/Reflow_to_Single_Column">linearisation</a> would be necessary, which completely overrides the layout of the website. </p>
            <p>Technologies like HTML/CSS, PDF and ePub have methods of reflowing content to fit the width of the user-agent window (viewport). When zooming in on HTML/CSS content, pixels increase in size, so an element that is 200 pixels wide at 200% takes 400 pixels of the width on screen.</p>

<p><strong>NB:</strong> Mobile devices are by necessity more limited in how they can resize content. This success criteria is to ensure the content is capable of resizing to a reasonable degree. In practice people will need to use a device or user-agent capable of reflowing content such as a desktop or laptop computer. In short, users will be able to get a &quot;mobile view&quot; of content on a desktop sized monitor that only scrolls in one direction. </p>

<p>The impact of horizontal scrolling can <a href="http://nosetothepage.org/Fitz/2dScroll.html">increase the effort required to read by 40-100 times</a>, so avoiding scrolling should be the aim whenever feasible.</p>

<p>The testing parameters are more defined than WCAG 2.0's 1.4.4, where the test should start with a browser at 1280px wide, and then zoom in to 400%. In desktop browsers that means your view is then 320px wide, equivalent to a mobile device. Many sites currently cater to that range of sizes, and that number will only increase as more sites update to be mobile friendly. What is not achieved by being mobile-friendly is testing under landscape orientation, rather than assuming a (portrait) mobile device.</p>

<p>It is also possible to meet this success criteria in PDF files by using the reflow feature of Acrobat Reader, which works well on many tagged PDFs with a defined order and structure. ePub files are designed to reflow so should be able to meet this criteria easily.		  </p>

	<h3>Benefits</h3>
				  <ul>
					<li>Responsive design and using native browser functions mitgates the need for screen magnification software and resultant loss of context from horizontal scrolling for users needing 400% or less content size.</li>
					<li>There are 6 times more people with low vision than are blind. (Wikipedia - As of 2015 there were 940 million people with some degree of vision loss.<sup id="cite_ref-GBD2015Pre_4-1" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_impairment#cite_note-GBD2015Pre-4">[4]</a></sup> 246 million had low vision and 39 million were blind.<sup id="cite_ref-WHO2014_3-5" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_impairment#cite_note-WHO2014-3">[3]</a></sup>)</li>
					<li>A significant proportion of people with low vision need more than a 200% increase in the size of content. From the <a href="http://webaim.org/projects/lowvisionsurvey/#magnification">Webaim survey</a> 25% of low vision users indicated needing magnification to 400% or more, which is probably more than the total number of screen reader users. (It is 42% for 300% or more).</li>
					<li>Horizontal scrolling makes reading difficult for people with low vision, or cognitive disorders, or people on mobile divices. Horizontal scrolling can <a href="http://nosetothepage.org/Fitz/2dScroll.html">increase the effort required to read by 40-100 times</a>, so avoiding scrolling should be the aim whenever feasible.</li>
					<li>Some people need to increase the size of all content in order to perceive information. </li>

			<section class="example">
			  <h3>Example 1</h3>
        <p>Shows when text size is increased, the heading overlaps the main text, the main text overlaps the sidebar text, and the sidebar text is cut off at the bottom.</p>
        <p><img src="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/low-vision-a11y-tf/wiki/images/7/71/Zoom-100.png" alt="web page with default text size, with heading spanning 2 columns, main text, and sidebar text" height="224" width="305"/> <img src="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/low-vision-a11y-tf/wiki/images/2/2a/Zoom-overlap.png" alt="Web page with larger text. Example shows that when text size is increased, the heading overlaps the main text, the main text overlaps the sidebar text, and the sidebar text is cut off at the bottom." height="224" width="305" />
		  <h3>Example 2</h3>
		  <p>Shows a page at 100% zoom with full user interface and no horizontal scroll bar. Page on the right shows the same page at 400% zoom with partial user interface, partial title, and horizontal scroll bar (indicated by red arrow).</p>
		  <p><img src="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/low-vision-a11y-tf/wiki/images/2/2b/Zoom-start.png" width="400" height="223" alt="page at 100%"> <img src="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/low-vision-a11y-tf/wiki/images/1/1b/Zoom_fail_400pc.png" alt="page at 400%" width="400" height="217"></p>
		  <p>The 2 images below have the same text taken from a 1280 pixel viewport and reduced 50%. The top image is 100% zoom. Lines have been added to show horizontal scrolling boundaries showing the chunks of information the user would navigate if the text did not wrap on zooming to 400%. There are 9 scroll boundaries. The bottom image is zoomed 400% and has no scroll boundaries. The reader simply reads the text in 1 screen with no horizontal scrolling.</p>
