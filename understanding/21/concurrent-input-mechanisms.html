		<h1>Understanding Concurrent Input Mechanisms</h1>
		<section id="intent">
			<h2>Intent</h2>
			<section id="benefits">
        <p>When interacting with web content, users may employ a variety of input mechanisms (such as keyboard and keyboard-like interfaces, or pointer devices such as a mouse, stylus or touchscreen). Certain tasks and interactions will be easier for a user to accomplish with a particular input device.
        Users may switch between input mechanisms at any point during their interaction. Input mechanisms may dynamically be added or removed. Even if a device has a primary/preferred input mechanism (for instance,
        the touchscreen on mobile phones and tablets), the user may instead employ alternative input mechanisms (such as a paired mouse or external keyboard in the case of mobile phones and tablets).</p>
        <p>Content must therefore be "input agnostic": not make assumptions about which input mechanism is the primary/preferred one, and not limit the user's interaction to any particular input mechanism, unless the restriction is essential, required to ensure the security of the content, or respect user settings.</p>
        <h3>Benefits</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Users are able to interact with web content with whichever input mechanism is available to them.</li>
          <li>Users are able to add/remove input mechanisms.</li>
          <li>Users can switch between input mechanisms when they desire or the circumstances demand it.</li>
				</ul>

		<section id="examples">
			<h2>Examples</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Even though content is being viewed on a mobile phone with a touchscreen, a user with a mobility impairment is able to pair a mouse and keyboard (or equivalent input devices) with the phone and operate the content - the content does not assume that the touchscreen is the only input modality the user will want to employ.</li>
          <li>On a touch-enabled laptop, users are still able to interact with content using their trackpad and keyboard.</li>
          <li>A user starts interacting with a page using a keyboard on their computer, and they attach a secondary touch-enabled monitor. Content can be operated using this newly added input mechanism, and does not assume that the first input mechanism it detected (the keyboard) is the only one in use.</li>
					<li>A speech input user navigates content using voice commands which translate to simulated keyboard commands; however, when simultaneously talking with a colleague, the user switches speech recognition off and uses the mouse instead.</li>
					<li>A touch-typing web application, which teaches users how to touch-type on a keyboard and/or measures their proficiency and speed, would be an example of an <em>essential</em> limitation to a particular input mechanism. In this case, the application would not be required to allow the user to switch to an alternative input mechanism.</li>

			<h2>Techniques</h2>
			<section id="sufficient">
				<h3>Sufficient</h3>
				<ul>
          <li>Only using high-level, input-agnostic event handlers (<code>focus</code>, <code>blur</code>, <code>click</code>) in Javascript (operating systems/UAs fire these events for all input mechanisms).</li>
          <li>Registering event handlers for keyboard/keyboard-like and pointer inputs simultaneously in Javascript (see <a href="https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/#examples">Example 1 in Pointer Events Level 2</a>)</li>
        </ul>
			</section>
			<section id="failure">
				<h2>Failure</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Registering <em>either</em> touch event handlers <em>or</em> keyboard/mouse event handlers based on a feature check/presence of a touchscreen in Javascript.</li>
          <li>Using CSS Media Queries Level 4 Interaction Media Features to determine what the UA deems to be the "primary" input mechanism and assuming no other input mechanisms are present/may be added/may be used.</li>
