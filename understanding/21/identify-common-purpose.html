		<h1>Understanding Identify Common Purpose</h1>
		<section id="intent">
			<h2>Intent</h2>
			<p class="instructions">This section contains the main explanatory content of the Understanding. It explains why the Guideline or Success Criterion exists and, at a high level, how to meet it.</p>
      <div >
      
      <p>The intent of this success criterion is to allow more support for user preferences and for user needs. Extra support such as familiar terms and symbols are needed for many users to be able to the web. If a user agent knows what a control does then the user agent can provide the extra support. </p>

<p>This success criteria requires the author to add the context of common buttons, links and field so that user agents knows what they do and can add extra support. It is similar to adding role information (as required by 4.2.1) but instead of providing information about what the UI component is (such as a button)  it provides information about what the action does (such as opening a help page).</p>

<p>For example when a browser knows that a field is expecting the user’s name, the autocomplete function can work. This is particularly useful for users with disabilities makes remembering or copying information harder,  and for users who make spelling mistakes or are likely to missread the label. This extra support prevents the user from making mistakes and makes it much easier for them to fill out forms.</p>

<p> In another example, a toolbar or browser extension can add symbols to common links and functions that are familiar to the user.  What is familiar for some users may not be familiar to other users, requiring them to learn new symbols. This success criteria enables personalization, such as  loading a set of symbols that is appropriate for the specific user, ensuring that all users find the icons simple and familiar. </p>

<p>In another example, browser extensions can add context sensitive help for known controls.  Purpose of controls may also benefit speech users who rely on accessible names. For requirements related to Accessible Name, refer to <em><a href="#">Success Criterion 2.4.12</a></em>
     </p>

      <h2>Meeting the success criteria</h2>

<p>Common ways to meet this success criteria include: </p>
<p><strong>Providing the purpose of a control using autocomplete</strong> - these techniques work on all the common fields.	</p>
<p><strong>Providing purpose of Controls using ARIA</strong>  - these techniques work on all the controls but is not yet a stable specification.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose of Controls using Microdata and the  ARIA vocabulary</strong>  - these techniques work on all the controls but is not yet a stable specification.</p> 
<p><strong>Purpose of Controls using schema.org</strong>  - these techniques work on the following items:</p>
++Add John’s Table++
<p>Autocomplete notation is as follows:</p>

				<h3>Benefits</h3>
				<p class="instructions">This explains how following the success criterion benefits particular types of users with disabilities.</p>
        <p>Following the success criterion benefits users with particular types of, or a combination between, these disabilities in multiple ways:</p>
				<p>This success criterion benefits people with many different cognitive disabilities including people with language related disabilities
memory related disabilities and disabilities that affects executive function and decision making.
 It provideds extra support such as: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Personalization  and the possibility for a familiar interface is available for users having trouble with all the different content they encounter on a daily basis</li>
          <li>Tool tips may be shown for when the function of specific common controls is not clear (anymore)</li>
          <li>Users for which written language is difficult to remember, symbols and graphics can be provided with which users are familiar</li>
				
					<li> Language they understand: <ul>
					<li>Users for which written language is difficult to understand, symbols and graphics can be provided with which users are familiar</li>
	<li>When using slang language or difficult words, a common (conventional) version provides the opportunity for users to understand</li>
          <li>For users who don’t master the language of the website that well a translation to their own language is possible (e.g. foreign, dialect or sign language)</li>
          			</ul></li>
					<li> Keyboard short cuts </li>
				       
        <li>Additional functionality on basis of the common controls can be provided to support the user in a variety of ways, such as autocomplete 
</li>
				</ul>
			
		
		  When metadata for common input controls is provided:
			<ul>
				<li>User agents, assistive technology and browser extensions can add context sensitive help or hide certain controls that the user finds hard to use correctly</li>
        <li>The auto complete function of user agents is able to help add support by the filling of predetermined data</li>
        <li>Makes personalization possible which could include loading a set of symbols that is appropriate for the specific user, ensuring that all users find the icons simple and familiar</li>
        <li>Can provide for recognizable terms which is key for certain individuals to being able to use the web</li>
        <li>Interfaces which change can be adjusted so that known patterns or tooltips may be shown which helps people for whom learning new things is difficult or slowed down in the course of the years and the cognitive load becomes too great</li>
        <li>See an <a href="https://github.com/ayelet-seeman/coga.personalisation/tree/ExampleWebPage/">example of an adaptive page</a></li>

				<h3>Example</h3>
        
For example a person growing older may find that their  ability to learn new things has slowed down. This includes learning new interfaces, symbols, and designs. They may also rely on tool tips. So long as the design is one they know they can use the application and stay in the work force. When interfaces change, they may try to learn the new interface, but the cognitive load becomes too great and they need to retire. Having familiar icons and buttons can help the user work for longer.
