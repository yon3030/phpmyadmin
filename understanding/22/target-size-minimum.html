            <p>The size of the <a>target</a> for <a>pointer inputs</a> is at least 24 by 24 <a>CSS pixels</a>, except where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Targets are spaced such that if a 24 CSS pixel diameter circle is centered on each target, none of the circles intersect another circle or target.</li>
                <li><strong>Equivalent:</strong> The function can be achieved through a different control on the same page that meets this criterion.</li>
                <li><strong>Inline:</strong> The target is in a sentence, or is in a bulleted or numbered list, or its size is otherwise constrained by the line-height of non-target text;</li>
                <li><strong>User agent control:</strong> The size of the target is determined by the user agent and is not modified by the author;</li>
                <li><strong>Essential:</strong> A particular presentation of the target is <a>essential</a> or is legally required for the information being conveyed;</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="note">Targets that allow for values to be selected spatially based on position within the target are considered one target for the purpose of the success criterion. Examples include sliders with granular values, color pickers displaying a gradient of colors, or editable areas where you position the cursor.</p>
            <p class="note">For inline targets the line-height should be interpreted as perpendicular to the flow of text. For example, in a language displayed top to bottom, the line-height would be horizontal.</p>

    <section id="intent">
        <h2>Intent of Target Size (Minimum)</h2>

        <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to help ensure targets can be easily activated without accidentally activating an adjacent target. When targets are small, it is difficult for users with hand tremors and those who have difficulty with fine motor movement to activate them accurately when there are other targets that are too close. Providing sufficient size, or sufficient spacing between targets, will reduce the likelihood of accidentally activating the wrong control.</p>

        <p>This Success Criterion defines a <em>minimum</em> size and, if this can't be met, a minimum spacing; using larger sizes will help many people use targets more easily. Meeting <a href="../21/target-size-enhanced.html">2.5.5 Target Size (Enhanced)</a> is recommended whenever possible.</p>

        <section id="exceptions">
            <h3>Exceptions</h3>
            <p>The requirement is for targets to be at least 24 by 24 CSS pixels in size. There are five exceptions:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> If a target is smaller than 24 by 24 CSS pixels but has sufficient spacing, it passes. The spacing is sufficient if for each target it is possible to draw a circle, centered on the target, with a diameter of 24 CSS pixels, without the circle overlapping the circle of any other other adjacent targets, nor the adjacent targets themselves.</li>
                <li><strong>Equivalent:</strong> In cases where a target does not have an size equivalent to 24 by 24 CSS pixels, but there is another control that can achieve the underlying function that <em>does</em> meet the minimum size, the target can be excepted based on the "Equivalent" exception.</li>
                <li><strong>Inline:</strong> The Success Criterion does not apply to inline targets in sentences, bulleted / numbers lists, or where the size of the target is constrained by the line-height of non-target text. This exception is allowed because text reflow based on viewport size makes it impossible for authors to anticipate where links may be positioned relative to one another. When multiple links are embedded in blocks of texts in smaller text sizes, maintaining a 24 CSS pixels offset between links in adjacent lines of text would require a large line height which can be undesirable in many design contexts. Also, inline numeric footnotes common in scientific texts may sometimes have a size well below 24 CSS pixels. <br/>Note: Stacked links in navigation structure that happen to use list markup do not count as inline links. Authors can anticipate the relative position of these links and provide sufficient target spacing.</li>
                <li><strong>User agent control:</strong> Browsers have default renderings of some controls, such as the days of the month calendar in an <code>input type="date"</code>. As long as the author has not modified the user agent default, the target size for a "User agent control" is excepted.</li>
                <li><strong>Essential:</strong> If the spacing of the targets is essential to the information being conveyed, the "Essential" exception applies. For example, in digital maps, the position of pins is analogous to the position of places shown on the map. If there are many pins close together, the offset between pins and neighboring pins will often be below 24 CSS pixels. It is essential to show the pins at the correct map location, therefore the Essential exception applies. As well, some jurisdictions legally require online forms to replicate paper forms, which can impose constraints on the size of targets. In such jurisdictions, any legal requirement to replicate small targets can be considered essential.</li>

        <section id="size-requirement">
            <h3>Size requirement</h3>

            <p>For a target to be "24 by 24 CSS pixels", it must be possible to draw a solid 24 by 24 CSS pixel (px) square, aligned to the horizontal and vertical axis such that the square is completely within the target (does not extend outside the target's area).</p>

            <figure id="basic-target-size">
                <img src="img/target-size-requirement-basic.png" alt="Three square boxes next to each other, each 24px wide." />
                <figcaption>Where targets are a 24 by 24px square (and larger is better), they meet the first line of the criterion and pass.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>The 24 by 24px square has to be aligned with the page, although the target itself could be skewed.</p>

            <figure id="basic-target-size-skewed">
                <img src="img/target-size-requirement-skewed.png" alt="A skewed rectangle that includes a 24 by 24px square within it." />
                <figcaption>So long as there is a solid 24 by 24px square within the target, it meets the first line of the criterion and passes.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>If a target does not include a 24 by 24px square but does have space around it, check the Spacing exception (below).</p>

            <figure id="basic-target-size-circle">
                <img src="img/target-size-requirement-circle.png" alt="A circle with a diameter of 24px, but not filling up a 24px square." />
                <figcaption>The rounded corners of the circle do not fill the 24 by 24px square so <strong>does not pass</strong> the first line of the criterion. However, depending on the spacing to other targets it may pass by the spacing exception.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>The requirement is independent of the zoom factor of the page; when users zoom in the CSS pixel size of elements does not change. This means that authors cannot meet it by claiming that the target will have enough spacing or sufficient size if the user zooms into the page.</p>
        
            <p>The requirement does not apply to targets while they are obscured by content displayed as a result of a user interaction or scripted behavior of content, for example:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>interacting with a combobox shows a dropdown list of suggestions</li>
                <li>activating a button displays a modal dialog</li>
                <li>content displays a cookie banner after page load</li>
                <li>content displays a "Take a survey" dialog after some period of user inactivity</li>
            </ul>    
            <p>The requirement does however apply to targets in any new content that appears on top of other content.</p>

            <p>While the Success Criterion primarily helps touch users by providing target sizing to prevent accidental triggering of adjacent targets, it is also useful for mouse or pen users. It reduces the chances of erroneous activation due to either a tremor or reduced precision, whether because of reduced fine motor control or input imprecision.</p>

        </section>
        <section id="spacing">
            <h3>Spacing</h3>

            <p>When the minimum size for a target is not met, spacing can at least improve the user experience. There is less chance of accidentally activating a neighboring target if a target is not immediately adjacent to another. Touchscreen devices and user agents generally have internal heuristics to identify which link or control is closest to a user's touch interaction - this means that sufficient spacing between targets can work as effectively as a larger target size itself.</p>

            <p>The following example shows a horizontal row of icon-based buttons. In the top row, the dimensions of each target are 24 by 24 CSS pixels, passing this Success Criterion. In the second row, the same targets are only 20 by 20 CSS pixels, but have a 4 CSS pixel space between them – as the target size is below 24 by 24 CSS pixels, these need to be evaluated against the Success Criterion's spacing exception, and they pass. In the last row, the targets are again 20 by 20 CSS pixels, but have no space between them – these fail the spacing exception, because when drawing the 24 CSS pixel diameter circles over the targets, the circles overlap.</p>

            <figure id="target-24x24-spacing">
                <img src="img/target-spacing-toolbar.svg" width="560" height="265" alt="Three rows showing a horizontal toolbar of icon-based controls with measurements. In the first row, the targets have a dimension of 24 by 24 CSS pixels, so pass. In the second row, the same toolbar is shown again, but overlaid with the 24 CSS pixel circles – the circles don't overlap, so pass. In the last row, the toolbar is shown again with the circles, but the circles overlap, so fail." />
                <figcaption>Three rows of targets, illustrating two ways of meeting this Success Criterion and one way of failing it (image shown to scale - <a href="img/target-spacing-toolbar.svg">see the scalable original version</a>)</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The next two illustrations show sets of buttons which are only 20 CSS pixels tall. In the first set, there are no targets immediately above or below the buttons, so they pass. In the second illustration, the buttons have been stacked on top of one another, resulting in a fail.</p>
            <figure id="target-44x20-spacing">
                <img src="img/target-size-one-row-20px.png" alt="A row of buttons which are more that 44px wide and 20 CSS pixels high. There are no targets above or below." />
                <figcaption>The widths of the buttons with adjacent neighbors is above 24 CSS pixels, while the height is only 20 CSS pixels. However, the lack of adjacent targets above and below means that the targets pass this Success Criterion.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <figure id="target-44x20-nospace">
                <img src="img/target-size-two-rows-20px.png" alt="Two rows of buttons only 20 CSS pixels high, with no spacing between them." />
                <figcaption><strong>Fail:</strong> Two rows of buttons, both with a height of only 20 CSS pixels. The rows are flush, with no gap between them, which means that the offset from the top of the targets in the top row to the top of targets in the row below is below 24px, thus failing the Success Criterion.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The following two illustrations show how menu items can be adjusted to properly meet this requirement. In the first illustration, the <q>About us</q> menu has been activated, showing that each of the menu item targets (text and padding) has a 24 CSS pixel height. In the second illustration, the same menu is expanded, but the menu items only achieve 20 CSS pixels in height.</p>
            <figure id="target-dropdown">
                <img src="img/target-size-dropdown.jpg" alt="A dropdown menu - a pass example with menu items 24 CSS pixels high, and a fail example with menu items only 20 CSS pixels high." />
                <figcaption>A dropdown menu is shown. The PASS example has menu items which are 24 CSS pixels high. In the FAIL example, the menu items are only 20 CSS pixels high.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p class="note">Users with different disabilities have different needs for control sizes. It can be beneficial to provide an option to increase the active target area without increasing the visible target size. Another option is to provide a mechanism to control the density of layout and thereby change target size or spacing, or both. This can be beneficial for a wide range of users. For example, users with visual field loss may prefer a more condensed layout with smaller sized controls while users with other forms of low vision may prefer large controls.</p>

    <section id="benefits">
        <h2>Benefits of Target Size (Minimum)</h2>
        <p>Having targets with sufficient size - or at least sufficient target spacing - can help all users who may have difficulty in confidently targeting or operating small controls. Users who benefit include, but are not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>People who use a mobile device where the touch screen is the primary mode of interaction;</li>
            <li>People using mouse, stylus or touch input who have mobility impairments such as hand tremors;</li>
            <li>People using a device in environments where they are exposed to shaking such as public transportation;</li>
            <li>Mouse users who have difficulty with fine motor movements;</li>
            <li>People who access a device using one hand;</li>
            <li>People with large fingers, or who are operating the device with only a part of their finger or knuckle.</li>
        </ul>

    </section>

    <section id="examples">
        <h2>Examples of Target Size (Minimum)</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Three buttons are on-screen and the target size of each button is 24 by 24 CSS pixels. Since the target size itself is 24 by 24 CSS pixels, no additional spacing is required, the Success Criterion passes.</li>
            <li>A row of buttons, each of which has a horizontal width of more than 24 CSS pixels, a height of only 20 CSS pixels, and vertical margin of 4 CSS pixels above and below the row of buttons. Since there is sufficient spacing both above and below the row of buttons, the Success Criterion passes.</li>
            <li>Links within a paragraph of text have varying target dimensions. Links within paragraphs of text do not need to meet the 24 by 24 CSS pixels requirements, so the Success Criterion passes.</li>
        </ul>
