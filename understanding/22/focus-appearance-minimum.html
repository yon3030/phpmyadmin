            <p class="conformance-level">AA</p>
        
            <p>For the keyboard focus indicator of each User Interface Component, all of the following are true:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Minimum area:</strong> The <a>focus indication area</a> is greater than or equal to a 1 <a>CSS pixel</a> border of the focused control, or has a thickness of at least 8 CSS pixels along the shortest side of the element.</li>
                <li><strong>Change of contrast:</strong> The color change for the focus indication area has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 with the colors of the unfocused state.</li>
                <li><strong>Adjacent contrast:</strong> The focus indication area has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against all adjacent colors for the minimum area or greater, or has a thickness of at least 2 CSS pixels.</li>
                <li><strong>Unobscured:</strong> The item with focus is not entirely hidden by author-created content</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="note">A keyboard focus indicator which has a pattern or gradient may have parts that do not meet the 3:1 contrast ratio for the change of contrast, as long as an area equal to the minimum does meet the contrast ratio.</p>
            <p class="note">If the control has a visible boundary smaller than the hit area, the size measure is taken from the visible boundary.</p>

        <h2>Intent of Focus Appearance (Minimum)</h2>


        <p>The purpose of this success criterion is to ensure a keyboard focus indicator is clearly visible and discernible. This criterion is closely related to <a href="../20/focus-visible.html">SC 2.4.7 focus visible</a> and defines a minimum level of visibility.</p>

        <p>For sighted people with mobility impairments who use a keyboard-like device (e.g. a switch, voice input), knowing the current point of focus is very important. Visible focus must also meet the needs of low-vision users, who may also be keyboard-only users.</p>
            
        <p>A keyboard focus indicator can take different forms, this success criterion sets a requirement to make it clearly distinguishable. For example, using a thick outline around the control that contrasts with the background would pass this criterion.</p>

        <section id="keyboard-focus">
            <h3>Keyboard focus</h3>
            <p>The keyboard focus is the point of interaction for someone using a keyboard. For environments with a keyboard operable interface, the keyboard focus can be moved around the interface in order to interact with different elements. Whichever element is being interacted with has focus.</p>

            <p>In web pages some components may receive focus as a user presses the tab key to move to that component and then use the arrow keys to select an option (e.g. tabs, menu items). The item considered to be focused is whichever is being interacted with. For example, if you tab to a menu and arrow-down to a menu item, it is the menu item that is in focus as pressing enter would activate the menu item.</p>

            <p>Some elements can take focus (such as the target of a skip link), however, it is only when the element is operable by keyboard controls that this criterion applies.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="size-of-indicator">
            <h3>Minimum area</h3>

            <p>The bigger the visible change, the easier it is for someone to see. Authors are encouraged to make the change as significant as possible, for example, by designing a thick border around the element, or significantly changing the background color.</p>

            <p class="note">A border is the perimeter of the control, and defines its shape. A border is not a reference to the CSS property of the same name.</p>

            <p>The minimum size of the focus indicator must be at least the area taken by a 1 CSS pixel border around the element. The indicator does not have to be a border, but the size of the area must be at least that size. For example, if a control is a rectangle of 90px wide and 30px tall, the size of the outer border is 90 + 90 + 30 + 30 = 240 CSS pixels.</p>

            <p class="note">A <a>CSS pixel</a> is what developers use in CSS declarations like “width: 200px”, it is device-independent and not to be confused with device pixels which vary depending on the physical pixel density. <br />
                The rest of this document notates CSS pixels as "px".
            </p>

            <p>The following 3 examples use a 90px wide by 30px tall button, therefore the surface area requirement is 240px. The middle button is focused in each example.</p>

            <figure id="focus-indicator-innerline">
                <img src="img/focus-indicator-innerline.png" alt="Three dark blue buttons on a white background. The middle button has a yellow inner border." width="284" />
                <figcaption>@@@ Update. The inner outline is slightly smaller than the outer edge of the component, but using a 2px thick indicator means it is well over the minimum requirement of 180px squared.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <figure id="focus-indicator-underline">
                <img src="img/focus-indicator-underline.png" alt="Three dark blue buttons on a white background. The middle button has a thick yellow line under the text." width="284" />
                <figcaption>@@@ Update.The thick (3px) yellow underline is almost as long as the longest edge therefore meets the requirement.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>If controls change size across different variations of a page (e.g. in a responsive design), it helps to use a proportionally sized indicator such as an outline or background change. In that way you can be sure of meeting the size requirement.</p>

            <p>Typical focus indicators:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>An outline around the whole component would pass the size requirement;</li>
                <li>Changing the background of a control would pass the size requirement;</li>
                <li>A 1px wide vertical line (such as a blinking cursor) would <strong>not pass</strong> the size requirement, a text input would need a larger or separate focus indicator.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you need to use complex mathematics to work out if a focus indicator is large enough, it is probably a sign that you should use a larger and proportional indicator that will provide a more visible indicator.</p>

            <section id="unusual-shapes">
                <h4>Unusual shapes and gradients</h4>
            
                <p>If you have an unusual shape, some mathematics may be required if the focus indicator is on the edge of the size requirement. For example, if the focusable control is a circle with a diameter of 100px, the circumference would be 314 pixels. A 1px (or greater) outline would meet the size criteria.</p>

                <figure id="focus-indicator-circle">
                    <img src="img/focus-indicator-circle.png" alt="Two orange circular buttons with an icon in the middle. The right hand circle has a dark outline around the whole circle to indicate focus" width="150" />
                    <figcaption>A circular button in the default state, and then with a focus indicator.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>If a focus indicator is an irregular shape, such as a drop-shadow under a star icon, it helps if the contrasting area is obviously quite large.</p>

                <figure id="focus-indicator-star-shadow">
                    <img src="img/focus-indicator-star-shadow.png" alt="Two yellow star symbols, the second has a dark drop-shadow." width="400" />
                    <figcaption>The default and focused states of a star component.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>What is the contrasting area of the drop shadow? The quick method is:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Look at the size of the component, how long is it around the edges?</li>
                    <li>Look at the (contrasting) area of the focus indicator.</li>
                    <li>Mentally compare the focus indicator to the border of the component.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If it is too close to call, you could extract the contrasting area of the focus indicator and evaluate the surface area.</p>

                <p>If a focus indicator has a gradient, the principle is to measure the contrast of the changed area, and ignore the change that does not meet 3:1.</p>
                <figure id="focus-indicator-box-shadow">
                    <img src="img/focus-indicator-box-shadow.png" alt="Three buttons, the middle with a heavy drop-shadow indicating focus." />
                    <figcaption>When a gradient is used on a focus indictor, the measure of surface area should only include the area that has changed enough to meet the 3:1 contrast ratio.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>If you take some spot-checks on the gradient area and establish what area meets the contrast, it is straightforward to work out if that area is sufficient.</p>
                <figure id="focus-indicator-box-shadow-only">
                    <img src="img/focus-indicator-box-shadow-only.png" alt="The middle button with the drop-shadow included, but the subtle grey areas removed to only show the contrasting area." />
                    <figcaption>The focused button with the non-contrasting areas removed, showing that it is a thick indicator that meets the requirements.</figcaption>

        <section id="change-of-color">
            <h3>Change of contrast</h3>

            <p>The greater the change of contrast between states the easier it is for users to see it. Authors are encouraged to make the change of color contrast as great as possible.</p>

            <p>When a component changes to include a focus indicator, that change can always be measured as a change of color contrast. For example, if a yellow outline is added to a button on a blue background, the change of color is from blue to yellow.</p>
                    
            <p class="note">Color contrast measurements in WCAG are based on luminance (brightness) regardless of the hue.</p>
            <figure id="focus-indicator-innerline-2">
                <img src="img/focus-indicator-innerline.png" alt="Three dark blue buttons on a white background. The middle button has a yellow inner border." width="284" />
                <figcaption>Adding a yellow outline to a link is a change of color from blue to yellow. That change has a contrast ratio of 12:1.</figcaption>
            </figure>        

                    
            <p>Text and non-text contrast measures use adjacent colors, this success criterion measures the <em>change</em> in color between non-focused and focused states.</p>

            <figure id="focus-indicator-non-contrast">
                <img src="img/focus-indicator-non-contrast.png" alt="Three buttons with light background and dark border on a white background. The middle button has a light grey outline." width="250" />
                <figcaption>The second link has a light-grey (#ccc) focus outline which <strong>fails</strong> this success criterion because the change from white-background to light-grey outline does not meet 3:1.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>It is possible to use visual patterns such as strips switching places to disguise a change of focus indicator. This is not considered a visible indicator.</p>

        </section>
        <section id="Contrast-thickness">
            <h3>Adjacent contrast</h3>

            <p>Where a control is a solid color, and you add a border or outline of a very similar color, it is difficult to perceive the change to the control.</p>

            <figure id="focus-indicator-thin-non-contrast">
                <img src="img/focus-indicator-thin-non-contrast.png" alt="Three dark buttons, the middle one appears very slightly larger due to a thin dark outline." width="255" />
                <figcaption>Adding a 1px dark outline around a dark button does not differentiate it, this example <strong>fails</strong> the success criteria.</figcaption>
            </figure>
                    
            <p>The requirement is to have an indicator that has a 3:1 contrast ratio with the adjacent colors (including the component), or to be separated from the component, or to be at least 2px thick.</p>

            <figure id="focus-indicator-thick-non-contrast">

                <figcaption>Adding an outline that is separated from the button helps to differentiate which one is focused.</figcaption>
            </figure>

        <section id="unobscured">
            <h3>Unobscured</h3>
            <p>Where other content can overlap with a focused item, the focused element should not be hidden. Typical content which can overlap focused items are sticky footers, sticky headers, or non-modal dialogues. As a user tabs through the page, these layers of content can obscure the focused item, including the focus indicator.</p>
            <p class="note">The criterion specifies the "focused item" in the unobscured bullet rather than the "focus indicator". The requirements for the indicator are set in the previous bullets, the unobscured bullet applies to the item as a whole.</p>

        </section>
        <section id="relation-non-text-color-contrast">
            <h3>Relation to non-text color contrast</h3>
            <p><a href="non-text-contrasast" class="sc">Success Criterion 1.4.11 Non-text contrast</a> requires that a UI component maintains contrast across it’s states, including when focused. For example, a checkbox must contrast with its adjacent colors, and the check within the checkbox must contrast with its adjacent colors. </p>
            
            <p>Focus-visible (enhanced) requires that the change of color contrast for the focus indicator (only) has contrast compared to the non-focused component.</p>
            
            <figure id="focus-indicator-checkboxs">
                <img src="img/focus-indicator-checkboxs.png" alt="Four checkboxes. Unchecked is a plain box. Focused has a circular line outside. Checked is dark green with a white tick. Focused and checked also has a dark green circle around it." width="400" />
                <figcaption>Four checkboxes in different combinations of checked and focused. The circular indicators (lines) provide a sufficient change of color contrast.</figcaption>
           </figure>
           
            <p>In the example above:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The checkbox has sufficient contrast with its adjacent background in default, focused, checked, and checked-focused states; </li>
                <li>The check (tick) within the checkbox contrasts with its adjacent color; </li>
                <li>The circular outline around the checkbox that indicates focus has a sufficient <em>change</em> of contrast.</li>
            </ul>
                    
            <figure id="focus-indicator-checked">
                <img src="img/focus-indicator-checked.png" alt="Two checkboxes, the second has a dark blue outline around it." width="300" />
                <figcaption>A default checkbox and a focused checkbox. </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>The contrast of the default checkbox passes 1.4.11 because the dark border and white background have a contrast ratio greater than 3:1. The 2px dark blue focus outline passes Focus Appearance (Minimum) because the change of contrast is greater than 3:1 with the white background. The component as a whole maintains contrast with the white background so continues to pass 1.4.11.</p>
