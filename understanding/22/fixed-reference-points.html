      <h2>Fixed Reference Points Normative Text</h2>
      <blockquote>
         <p class="conformance-level">A</p>

         <p>When a <a>web page</a> or <a>set of web pages</a> is an <a>electronic publication</a> with <a>pagebreak locators</a>, a mechanism is available to navigate to each locator and each locator maintains its place in the flow of content, even when the formatting or platform change.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h3>Definitions:</h3>
      <p><strong>electronic publication</strong>: Content presented as a collection of related articles, document in the form of a book, textbook, magazine article, journal, a single journal article that is presented as having different pages, scholarly journal, or newspaper article in digital format.</p>
      <p><strong>pagebreak locators</strong> Visual and/or programmatic markers that are arranged in a meaningful sequence to determine the location of a page in relation to others in the set.</p>
      <p>Examples would be:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Corresponding pages between a print book and a digital version of the same publication. (A digital pixel precise manifestation of the published print version)</li>
         <li>Page numbering in the print version of an ebook</li>
         <li>Page numbering in an electronic version of the ebook</li>
         <li>A digital book is published is with no print equivalent and page break locators are inserted which supports direct navigation across platforms and form factors.</li> 
         <li>Virtual page</li>  
         <li>Synchronizing reading people with different form factors and platforms, screen sizes, can be on the same page.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Intent of Fixed Reference Points</h2>


      <p>The purpose of this success criteria is to allow users with disabilities to find references to content based on the page locators found in the default view or printed version of a publication.</p>

      <p>The term “on the same page” is common in English to describe when two people are talking about the same thing and agree on the content of the conversation. This success criteria makes sure that all users can literally be on the same page.</p>
         
      <p>Page numbering has long been a fundamental way to identify and communicate the location of written content. They are used constantly in references, footnotes, endnotes, and bibliographies. Particularly, they are critical in academic and learning environments.</p>

      <p>Electronic publishing has provided valuable access to content for people who are blind, have low vision, dyslexia or other cognitive disabilities. In order to consume the information the content may be adapted to use a different  layout, or presented to them using assistive technology.  If there is no clear way to find a specific page from the print version that was referenced by a professor in class, because the electronic version is zoomed-in and that paragraph is on page 145 of the user’s version of the content, the user misses out on valuable and sometimes critical information to understanding the reference.</p>

		<p class="note">The term “article” in the success criteria does not refer to the <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> tag in PDF or InDesign.</p>

      <h2>Benefits of Fixed Reference Points</h2>
      
      <ul>
         <li>People who are blind or who have low vision or those who may be magnifying content because of a cognitive disability will still be able to find their place and find references to content that are based on page numbers of the print or default version of the publication.</li>

      <h2>Examples of Fixed Reference Points</h2>

      <ul>
         <li>An electronic publication (ePub) document includes navigation to page number references that match the paper version of the publication.</li>

      <h2>Tests</h2>
      <section class="test-procedure">
         <h3>Procedure</h3>
         <p>Identify page break locators in the content.</p>
         <ol>
            <li>If the electronic publication is in one url page, check that a user can navigate focus to each page break locator from somewhere else on the page without relying on the natural tab order.</li>
            <li>If the electronic publication is across a set of pages there is a way to navigate to each page break locator from another web page in the set.</li>
         </ol>

         <h3>Expected Results</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>#1 or #2 is true depending on whether it is an electronic publication on on web page (url) or across set of web pages.</li>
