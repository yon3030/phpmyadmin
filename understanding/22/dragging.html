		<p>All functionality that uses a <a>dragging movement</a> for operation can be operated by a single pointer without dragging, unless dragging is <a>essential</a>.</p>
		<p class="note">This requirement applies to web content that interprets pointer actions (i.e. this does not apply to actions that are required to operate the user agent or assistive technology).</p>

        <h2>Intent of Dragging</h2>


        <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure functionality that uses a dragging movement (e.g. sliders, drag-and-drop interfaces) has another <a href="#dfn-single-pointer">single pointer</a> mode of operation without the need for the dexterity required to drag elements.</p>

        <p>Some people cannot perform dragging motions in a precise manner. Others use a specialized or adapted input device such as a head pointer, eye-gaze system, or speech-controlled mouse emulator, which makes dragging cumbersome, error-prone, or outright impossible.</p>
            
        <p>When an interface implements functionality that uses dragging motions, some users can tap or click, but not accurately maintain contact whilst performing a gesture. An alternative method must be provided so that users with mobility impairments that use a pointer (mouse, pen, or touch contact) can use the functionality.</p>
		
		<p>There is already a requirement for dragging features to be keyboard accessible, however, it is possible to create an interface that works with dragging and keyboard controls that does not work using only clicks or taps.</p>

      <h2>Benefits of Dragging</h2>
      
      <ul>
         <li>Users who struggle with performing path-based gestures can still operate an interface with a pointer interface.</li>
      </ul>

   <section id="examples">
      <h2>Examples of Dragging</h2>

      <ul>
         <li>A sortable list of elements may, after focussing a list element, provide adjacent controls for moving the element up or down in the list by simply tapping/clicking on those controls.</li>
         <li>A kanban implementation may provide an additional pop-up menu for focused elements that can be activated by simple clicks/taps providing an option for moving the selected element to another kanban silo.</li>
         <li>A radial control widget where the value can be set by dragging includes a text field that presents the current value and offers the input of the desired value via a keyboard (including on-screen virtual keyboards).</li>  
         <li>A map allows users to drag the view of the map around, and the map has up/down/left/right buttons to move the view as well.</li>        
      </ul>
