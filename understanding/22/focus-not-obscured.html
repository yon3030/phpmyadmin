        <h2>Focus Not Obscured Success Criterion text</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <p>When a <a>user interface component</a> receives keyboard focus, the component is not entirely hidden due to author-created content.</p>

        <h2>Intent of Focus Not Obscured</h2>

        <p>For sighted people with mobility impairments who use a keyboard-like device (e.g., a switch, voice input), knowing the current point of focus is very important. When progressing through a page other content can hide the focused element.</p>

        <p>Where other content can overlap with a focused item, the focused element should not be hidden. Typical types of content that can overlap focused items are sticky footers, sticky headers, or non-modal dialogues. As a user tabs through the page, these layers of content can obscure the focused item, including the focus indicator. If the interface is configurable so that the user can move toolbars and non-modal dialogs around, then only the initial positions of user-movable content would be considered for testing and conformance of this success criterion.</p>

      <h2>Benefits of Focus  Not Obscured</h2>
      
      <ul>
         <li>This Success Criterion helps anyone who relies on the keyboard to operate the page by letting them visually determine the component on which keyboard operations will interact at any point in time.</li>
         <li>People with attention limitations, short term memory limitations, or limitations in executive processes benefit by being able to discover where the focus is located.</li>
      </ul>

   <section id="examples">
      <h2>Examples of Focus  Not Obscured</h2>

      <ul>
         <li>A page has a sticky footer (attached to the bottom of the vieport). When tabbing down the page the focused item is not hidden by the footer.</li>    
      </ul>
