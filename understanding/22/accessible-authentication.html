        <blockquote>
            <p class="conformance-level">AA</p>
            

            <p>For each step in an authentication process that relies on a <a>cognitive function test</a>, at least one other authentication method is available that does not rely on a cognitive function test, or a mechanism is available to assist the user in completing the cognitive function test.</p>
            <p class="note">Note: Examples of mechanisms include: 1) support for password entry by password managers to address the memorization cognitive function test, and 2) copy and paste to help address transcription cognitive function test.</p>

        </blockquote>
        <h2>Cognitive function test definition</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <p>A task that requires the user to remember, manipulate, or transcribe information. Examples include, but are not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>memorization, such as remembering a username, password, set of characters, images, or patterns. The common identifiers name, e-mail, and phone number are not considered cognitive function tests as they are personal to the user and consistent across websites;</li>
                <li>transcription, such as typing in characters;</li>
                <li>use of correct spelling;</li>
                <li>performance of calculations;</li>
                <li>solving of puzzles.</li>

        <h2>Intent of Accessible Authentication</h2>

        <p>The purpose of this success criterion is to ensure there is an accessible, easy-to-use, and secure method to log in and access content. Most web sites rely on usernames and passwords for logging in. Memorizing a username and password (or transcribing it manually) places a very high or impossible burden upon people with certain cognitive disabilities. </p>
 
        <p>Remembering a password is a <a>cognitive function test</a>. Such tests are known to be problematic for many people with cognitive disabilities. Whether it is remembering random strings of characters, a pattern gesture to perform on a touch screen, or identifying which images include a particular object, cognitive function tests will exclude some people. When a cognitive function test is used, at least one other authentication method must be available which is not a cognitive function test.</p>
            
        <p class="note">Web sites can employ username (or email) and password inputs as an authentication method if it is properly marked-up and does not block copy-paste functionality. If the login form meets <a href="identify-input-purpose">Success Criterion 1.3.5 Input Purpose</a>,  <a href="info-and-relationships">Success Criterion 1.3.1: Info and Relationships</a>, and does not block copy-paste then browser features or password managers can save the userâ€™s information and refill the login.</p>

        <p>If there is more than one step in the authentication process, such as with multi-factor authentication, all steps should comply with this success criterion. There should be a path through authentication that does not rely on cognitive function tests.</p>

        <p>Being able to recover or change the email and password is an important part of authentication. If the user is authenticating with alternative information in order to recover their account, there needs to be a method that is not a cognitive function test.</p>

        <p>Copy and paste can be relied on to avoid transcription. Examples of this are password managers automatically filling in username and passwords, or web-based command line interfaces asking for a password that can be copied from a local source. Blocking people or programs from pasting into authentication fields, or using a different format between the copied text and the input field, would force the user to transcribe information and therefore fail this criterion.</p>

        <p>If a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/turingtest/">CAPTCHA</a> is used as part of an authentication process, there must be a method that does not include a cognitive function test. If the test is based on something the website has set such as remembering or transcribing a word, or recognizing a picture the website provided, that would be a cognitive functional test. Recognizing common objects, or a picture the user has provided, would not be a cognitive functional test. Some forms of object recognition may require an understanding of a particular culture. For example, taxis can appear differently in different locales. This is an issue for many people, including people with disabilities, but it is not considered an accessibility-specific issue.</p>
        <p>Some CAPTCHAs and cognitive function tests used for authentication may only appear in certain situations, such as when ad blockers are present, or after repeated incorrect password entry. This criterion applies when these tests are used regardless of whether they are used every time or only triggered by specific scenarios.</p>

      <h2>Benefits of Accessible Authentication</h2>
      
      <p>People with cognitive issues relating to memory, reading (e.g. dyslexia), numbers (e.g. dyscalculia), or perception-processing limitations will be able to authenticate irrespective of the level of their cognitive abilities.</p>

      <h2>Examples of Accessible Authentication</h2>

      <ul>
         <li>A web site uses a properly marked up username (or email) and password fields as the login authentication (meeting <a href="identify-input-purpose">Success Criterion 1.3.5 Input Purpose</a> and  <a href="info-and-relationships">Success Criterion 1.3.1: Info and Relationships</a>). Copy &amp; paste is not blocked on the inputs, so the user's browser or extension can identify the purpose of the inputs and automatically fill in the username and password.</li>
         <li>A web site uses WebAuthn so the user can authenticate with their device instead of username/password. The user's device could use any available modality. Common methods on laptops and phones are facial-scan, fingerprint, and pin number. The web site is not enforcing any particular use, it is assumed a user will setup a method that suits them.</li>
         <li>A web site offers the ability to login with a 3rd party provider using the OAuth method.</li>
         <li>A web site that requires 2-factor authentication allows for multiple options for the 2nd factor, including a USB-based method where the user simply presses a button to enter a time-based token.</li>
      </ul>
