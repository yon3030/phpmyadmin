            <p class="conformance-level">AA</p>
            
            <p>If an authentication process relies on a <a>cognitive function test</a>, at least one other method must also be available that does not rely on a cognitive function test. </p>

        <h2>Cognitive function test definition</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <p>A task that requires the user to remember, manipulate, or transcribe information. Examples include, but are not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>memorization, such as remembering a username, password, set of characters, images or patterns;</li>
                <li>transcription, such as typing in characters;</li>
                <li>use of correct spelling;</li>
                <li>performance of calculations;</li>
                <li>solving of puzzles.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="note">Remembering your own name, email address, or phone number is not considered a cognitive function test.</p>

        <h2>Intent of Accessible Authentication</h2>

        <p>The purpose of this success criterion is to ensure there is an accessible, easy-to-use, and secure method to log in and access content. Most web sites rely on usernames and passwords for logging in. Memorizing a username and password (or transcribing it manually) places a very high or impossible burden upon people with certain cognitive disabilities. </p>
 
        <p>Cognitive function tests are known to be problematic for many people with cognitive disabilities. Whether it is remembering random strings of characters, a pattern gesture to perform on a touch screen, or identifying which images include a particular object, this form of test will exclude some people. When a cognitive function test is used, at least one other authentication method must be available which is not a cognitive function test.</p>
            
        <p class="note">Web sites can employ username (or email) and password inputs as an authentication method if it meets <a href="#">Success Criterion 1.3.5 Input Purpose</a> and password managers / browser functionality is not blocked. When properly marked up, browser features or password managers can save the user’s information and refill the login.</p>

        <p>If there is more than one step in the authentication process, such as with multi-factor authentication, all steps should comply with this success criterion. There should be a path through authentication that does not rely on cognitive function tests.</p>

      <h2>Benefits of Accessible Authentication</h2>
      
      <p>People with cognitive issues relating to memory, reading (e.g. dyslexia), numbers (e.g. dyscalculia), or perception-processing limitations will be able to authenticate irrespective of the level of their cognitive abilities.</p>

   <section id="examples">
      <h2>Examples of Accessible Authentication</h2>

      <ul>
         <li>A web site uses a properly marked up email and password as the login authentication.</li>
         <li>A web site uses WebAuthn so the user can authenticate with their device instead of username/password. The user’s device could use any available modality. Common methods on laptops and phones are facial-scan, fingerprint, and pin number. The web site is not enforcing any particular use, it is assumed a user will setup a method that suits them.</li>
         <li>A web site offers the ability to login with a 3rd party provider using the OAuth method.</li>
         <li>A web site that requires 2-factor authentication allows for multiple options for the 2nd factor, including a USB-based method where the user simply presses a button to enter a time-based token.</li>
      </ul>
