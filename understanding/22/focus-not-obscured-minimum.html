        <h2>Focus Not Obscured Success Criterion text</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <p>When a <a>user interface component</a> receives keyboard focus, the component is not entirely hidden due to author-created content.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="note">If the interface is configurable so that the user can reposition content such as toolbars and non-modal dialogs, then only the initial positions of user-movable content would be considered for testing and conformance of this Success Criterion.</p>

        <h2>Intent of Focus Not Obscured</h2>

        <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that the item receiving keyboard focus is always visible in the user's viewport. For sighted people who rely on a keyboard (or on a device that operates through the keyboard interface, such as a switch or voice input), knowing the current point of focus is critical. The component with focus signals the interaction point on the page. Where users cannot see the item with focus, they may not know how to proceed, or may even think the system has become unresponsive.</p>
        
         <p>In recognition of the complex responsive designs common today, this AA criterion allows for the component receiving focus to be <em>partially</em> obscured by other author-created content. A partly obscured component can still be very visible, although the more of it that is obscured, the less easy it is to see. For that reason, authors should attempt to design interactions to reduce the degree and frequency with which the item receiving focus is partly obscured. For best visiblity, <em>none</em> of the component receiving focus should be hidden. This preferred outcome is covered by the AAA criterion <a href="focus-not-obscured-enhanced.html">Focus Not Obscured (Enhanced)</a>.</p>

         <p>Typical types of content that can overlap focused items are sticky footers, sticky headers, and non-modal dialogs. As a user tabs through the page, these layers of content can obscure the item receiving focus, along with its focus indicator.</p>
 
          <p>A notification implemented as sticky content, such as a cookie banner, will fail this Success Criterion if it entirely obscures a component receiving focus. Ways of passing include making the banner modal so the user has to dismiss the banner before navigating through the page, or using <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-scroll-snap/#propdef-scroll-padding">scroll padding</a> so the banner does not overlap other content. Notifications that do not require user action could also meet this criterion by closing on loss of focus.</p>
 
         <p>Another form of obscuring can occur where light boxes or other semi-opaque effects overlap the item with focus. While less than 100 percent opacity is not causing the component to be "entirely hidden," such semi-opaque overlaps may cause a failure of <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-appearance.html">2.4.11 Focus Appearance</a>. When a focus indicator can be covered by a semi-opaque component, the ability of the focus indicator to pass 2.4.11 should be evaluated (and pass) while the focus indicator is under the semi-opaque component. The intention in both situations is that the component receiving focus should never be obscured to the point a user cannot tell which item has focus.</p>

       <section id="Considerations">
         <h3>Considerations</h3>
         The following sections provided clarity on how to assess Focus Not Obscured (Minimum) in certain scenarios.
         <section><h4>User-movable</h4>
         <p>This SC contains a note regarding content that can be repositioned. If users can move content regions, then they can potentially position them such that they obscure other content that may receive focus. In such a case, the author is only responsible for ensuring that the movable content <em>in its initial position</em> does not obscure the item receiving focus.</p>
         <p>This note is intended to accommodate a common interaction in complex applications such as authoring tools, where the main editing region (also called a canvas) can be enhanced by displaying toolbars or other panels, which can be repositioned around the canvas. It is possible to design such toolbars so they do <em>not</em> obscure focus. Authors are encouraged to do so, as well as pursue techniques which ensure equitable keyboard use of such toolbars. However, in recognition of the complexities involved in responsive design as well as in supporting the ability to transform the text size and spacing of content, only the starting position of such side panels is assessed.</p>
     
       </section>
       <section>
         <h4>Modal dialogs versus overlays</h4>
         <p>A properly constructed modal dialog will always pass this SC. Even if it appears directly on top of an item with focus, the dialog takes focus on appearance, and thus the item receiving focus -- the dialog or one of its components -- is visible. A properly constructed modal maintains that focus and prevents interaction outside the modal until it is dismissed.</p>
         <p>A dialog-like overlay that does not take focus on appearance or does not constrain interaction to the overlay (thus allowing focus to exit into the content behind it) will be at risk of failing this SC.</p>
       </section>
       <section>
         <h4>Non-persistent content dismissing on loss of focus</h4>
         <p>A number of interactions on the web involve the disclosure of content overlays that obscure other content. Examples of such overlays are menu items, select element items, combobox lists (and other dropdown items), date picker calendars, and tooltips. If such overlay content persists after the user has activated one of its items or has moved the focus away from the triggering item and the overlay, it is at risk of failing this SC.</p>

    <section id="benefits">
      <h2>Benefits of Focus Not Obscured</h2>
      
      <ul>
         <li>Sighted users who rely on a keyboard interface to operate the page will be able to see the component which gets keyboard focus. Such users include those who rely on devices which use the keyboard interface, including speech input, sip-and-puff software, onscreen keyboards, scanning software, and a variety of assistive technologies and alternate keyboards.</li>
         <li>People with limited or low vision, who may primarily user a pointer for screen orientation and repositioning, nonetheless benefit from a visible indication of the current point of keyboard interaction, especially where magnification reduces the overall viewing portion of the screen.</li>
         <li>People with attention limitations, short term memory limitations, or limitations in executive processes benefit by being able to discover where the focus is located.</li>
      </ul>

   <section id="examples">
      <h2>Examples of Focus Not Obscured</h2>

      <ul>
         <li>A page has a sticky footer (attached to the bottom of the viewport). When tabbing down the page the focused item is not hidden by the footer.</li>
