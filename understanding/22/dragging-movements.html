        <h2>Intent of Dragging Movements</h2>


        <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure functionality that uses a dragging movement (e.g. sliders, drag-and-drop interfaces) has another <a href="#dfn-single-pointer">single pointer</a> mode of operation without the need for the dexterity required to drag elements.</p>

        <p>Some people cannot perform dragging motions in a precise manner. Others use a specialized or adapted input device such as a head pointer, eye-gaze system, or speech-controlled mouse emulator, which makes dragging cumbersome, error-prone, or outright impossible.</p>
            
        <p>When an interface implements functionality that uses dragging movements, some users can tap or click, but not accurately maintain contact whilst performing the movement. An alternative method must be provided so that users with mobility impairments who use a pointer (mouse, pen, or touch contact) can use the functionality.</p>
		
     <p>Success Criteria 2.1.1 Keyboard and 2.1.3 Keyboard (No Exception) require dragging features to be keyboard accessible; however, it is possible to create an interface that works with dragging and keyboard controls that does not work using only clicks or taps.</p>

    <p>This Success Criterion applies to dragging movements as opposed to pointer gestures, which are covered in Success Criterion 2.5.1 Pointer Gestures. Pointer gestures include directional path-based as well as multi-point gestures. In contrast, for dragging movements, only the start and end point of the movement matters, not the actual path.</p>

      <p>There may be cases where a dragging movement is essential, for example, drawing a freeform figure, or playing a game where the aim is to follow a particular track as accurately as possible. The criterion has an exception for these cases.</p>

      <p>Some tasks may typically involve dragging, such as sorting items in a list, but as there are other ways to achieve that task they are not considered essential.</p>
      
      <h3>Distinguishing dragging movements from path-based pointer gestures</h3>
      
      <p>Dragging movements covered in this Success Criterion are pointer interactions where only the endpoints matter. Once the pointer engages with a target, the direction of the dragging motion does not factor into the interaction until the pointer disengages the target. Since the dragging movement does not have an intermediate point, the dragging motion can go in any direction. Path-based gestures covered in Success Criterion 2.5.1 Pointer Gestures.

      <h2>Benefits of Dragging Movements</h2>
      
      <ul>
         <li>Users who struggle with performing dragging motions can still operate an interface with a pointer interface.</li>
      </ul>
      
   </section>
   
   <section id="examples">
      <h2>Examples of Dragging Movements with alternatives</h2>

      <ul>
         <li>In a sortable list, when a list item is activated by tapping or focusing, adjacent arrows pointing up and down are shown. Users can move the selected list item up or down the list simply by tapping or clicking on those arrows.</li>
         <li>A kanban implementation may provide an additional pop-up menu for focused elements that can be activated by simple clicks/taps providing an option for moving the selected element to another kanban silo.</li>
         <li>A map allows users to drag the view of the map around. The map also shows up/down/left/right buttons to move the view in a stepwise fashion.</li>
