        <h2>Intent of Focus Not Obscured (Enhanced)</h2>

        <p>The purpose of this Success Criterion is to ensure that a component with keyboard focus is visible. This criterion is closely related to <a href="./focus-not-obscured.html">Focus Not Obscured (Minimum)</a> but requires that the whole of the component is visible.</p>
