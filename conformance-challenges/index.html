            <p>This early draft document explores situations for which the WCAG 2.x conformance model, and success criteria testability, are challenging to apply to a broad range of websites and web applications. The purpose of the document is to help understand these challenges more holistically, so that we can build better solutions in the future. For this initial draft, the challenges covered broadly fall into four main areas:</p>
            <ol>
		    <li>Numerous WCAG Guidelines and Success Criteria need human involvement (with current state of technology) to test and verify conformance, which is especially challenging to scale to <a>large websites</a> and to <a>dynamic websites</a>;</li>
                <li>Large and dynamic sites have portions that are always under construction, which is challenging to address with the WCAG 2.x conformance model which makes no allowance for that;</li>
                <li>Third parties frequently add and change content on large and dynamic sites, and related non-conformities in such content make WCAG 2.x conformance significantly challenging; and</li>
                <li>Applying the WCAG 2.x conformance model is challenging to do for non-web information and communications technologies (ICT)  which it was never designed for but which it is nonetheless sometimes applied.</li>
            </ol>
	    <p>While these four main areas apply to websites and web applications broadly, this early version of the document focuses particularly on situations involving large, <a>complex</a>, and dynamic websites.</p>
            <p>One of the reasons for publication of this document as a First Public Working Draft is to seek additional contributions describing any additional challenges, or further illustration of challenges in the existing identified areas below, ahead of work developing solutions. It is expected that a more thorough understanding of these challenges can lead to either a new conformance model, or an alternative model that is more appropriate for large, complex, and/or dynamic websites.  Ideally, such a model would also be able to distinguish between websites that are substantially accessible for most visitors with disabilities most of the time, and websites that are largely unusable by a significant portion of visitors with a disability.</p>
            <p>This document also includes previously published research from the Silver Task Force and Community Group that was specifically related to Challenges with Conformance.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Unchanged since WCAG 2.0 was published in December 2008, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines list a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#conformance">set normative of requirements “in order for a web page to conform to” WCAG 2.x</a>, including setting forth that conformance “is for full Web page(s) only, and cannot be achieved if part of a Web page is excluded”, along with a Note that states “If a page cannot conform (for example, a conformance test page or an example page), it cannot be included in the scope of conformance or in a conformance claim.”  Also unchanged is text setting forth what is allowed in any optional “Conformance Claims”, starting with text that states: “Conformance is defined only for  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#webpagedef">Web pages</a>. However, a conformance claim may be made to cover one page, a series of pages, or multiple related Web pages.”</p>
            <p>For the purposes of this document, we use the term “WCAG 2.x conformance model” to refer to the normative text in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#conformance">Conformance section</a> of WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1.  We also note that this model was expressly defined for individual full web pages of a website, or for a series of web pages when they represent a process.  We further note that a conformance claim is specifically defined as something that covers “one page, a series of pages, or multiple related Web pages.” These terms, “a series of” and “multiple” are commonly understood in English to mean a fairly small number of items – more than one (e.g. “several”), but not many thousands or millions.</p>
            <p class="note">Language like “A Series of Unfortunate Events” “she published a series of books”, or “I subscribed to the concert series”; and language like “there were multiple births” or “there are multiple owners” all are broadly understood as not numbering in many thousands or millions.</p>
            <p>Large websites are often highly complex, with substantial dynamic content, including content updates, new content, and user interface changes that happen almost continuously, perhaps at the rate of hundreds or even thousands of page updates per second. This is especially the case where third parties are actively populating and changing site content. Fundamentally, these large sites are never finished. Some portion is always changing. In such situations, we should anticipate that portions of a web site will be incomplete or evolving for various reasons at any moment.  Thus, the likelihood that every last page (out of what might be millions or billions of pages) can satisfy each and every one of the WCAG success criteria 100% of the time is so low as to be impossible to expect. </p>

	    <h3>Goals</h3>
	    <p>The goals of this document are to catalog and characterize the challenges with accessibility guidelines conformance, and conformance verification.  We believe that a better understanding of the situations in which WCAG 2.x
	    conformance applies poorly if at all, and the places where accessibility conformance verification scales poorly if at all, can lead to more effective conformance models and testing approaches in the future.</p>
	    <p>We are publishing this document now, as a First Public Working Draft, to seek public comment and assistance in further cataloging and characterizing these challenges, so that this work can become input into the next major
	    revision of W3C accessibility
	    guidelines  (currently in early development under the name  "Silver").</p>

            <h2>Challenge #1: Scaling Conformance Verification</h2>
            <p>A challenge common to many of the WCAG Guidelines and Success Criteria is the inability for automatic testing to fully validate conformance to WCAG 2.x and the subsequent time, cost, and expertise needed to perform the necessary manual test to cover the full range of the requirements.  
HTML markup can be automatically validated to confirm that it is used according to specification, but a human is required to verify whether the HTML elements used correctly reflect the meaning of the content. For example, text on a web page marked contained in a paragraph element may not trigger any failure in an automated test, nor would an image with alternative text  equal to "red, white, and blue bird", but a human will identify that the text needs to be enclosed in a heading element to reflect the actual use on the page, and also that the proper alternative text for the image is "American Airlines logo". Many existing accessibility success criteria expect informed human evaluation to ensure that the end users benefit from conformance.
	    The same can be said of very large web-based applications that are developed in an agile manner with updates delivered in rapid succession, often on an hourly basis.</p>
            <p>We can think of this as the distinction between quantitative and qualitative analysis. We know how to automatically test for and count the occurrences of relevant markup. However, we do not yet know how to automatically verify the quality of what that markup conveys to the user. In the case of adjudging appropriate quality, informed human review is still required.</p>
	    <p>It is important to recognize that the places where WCAG 2.x conformance applies poorly, and the places where conformance verification scales poorly, nonetheless remain important to achieving accessibility.  For example, while requiring human judgement to validate a page may not scale (the core of Challenge #1 below), absent that human judgement it may not be possible to deliver a fully accessible web page.  Similarly, while it may not be possible to ensure that all 3rd party content is fully accessible (the subject of Challenge #3 below), absent review of that content by a human sufficiently versed in accessibility it may again not be possible to ensure that content is fully accessible.  Human judgement is a core part of much of WCAG 2.x for good reasons, and the challenges that arise from it important to successfully grapple with.</p>
            <p>This (growing) section describes challenges with applying the WCAG 2.x conformance model to specific Guidelines and Success Criteria, primarily based on required human involvement in evaluation of conformance to them. In this draft, the list is not  exhaustive, but we intend it to cover all known challenges with at least all A and AA Success Criteria, by the time this Note is completed.</p>
            <section>
                <h3>
                    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#text-alternatives">Text Alternatives (Guideline 1.1) for Non-Text Content (Success Criterion 1.1)</a>
                </h3>
                <p>Text alternatives for images are an early, and still widely used, accessibility enhancement to HTML. Yet text alternatives remain one of the more intractable success criteria to assess with automated accessibility checking. While testing for the presence of alternative text is straightforward, and a collection of specific errors (such as labeling a graphic "spacer.gif") can be identified by automated testing, human judgment remains necessary to evaluate whether or not any particular text alternative for a graphic is correct and conveys the true meaning of the image.  Image recognition techniques are not mature enough to fully discern the underlying meaning of an image and the intent of the author in its inclusion. As a simple example, an image or icon of a paper clip would likely be identified by image recognition simply as a "paper clip." However, when a paper clip appears in content often its meaning is to show there is an attachment. In this specific example, the alternative text should be "attachment," not "paper clip." Similarly, the image of a globe (or any graphical object representing planet Earth) can be used for a multiplicity of reasons, and the appropriate alternative text should indicate the reason for that use and not descriptive wording such as "globe" or "planet Earth." One not uncommon use of a globe today expands to allow users to select their preferred language, but there may be many other reasonable uses of such an icon.</p>

            <section>
                <h3><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#time-based-media">Time-Based Media (Guideline 1.2)</a></h3>
                <p>Practices for creating alternatives to spoken dialog, and to describe visual content, were established in motion picture and TV content well before the world wide web came into existence. These practices formed the basis of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/media-accessibility-reqs/">Media Accessibility User Requirements (MAUR)</a> for time-based streaming media on the web in HTML5, which now supports both captioning and descriptions of video.</p>
                <p>Yet, just as with text alternatives, automated techniques and testing aren’t sufficient for creating and validating accessible alternatives to time-based media.  For example, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) often fails when the speech portion of the audio is low quality, isn’t clear, or has background noise or sound-effects.  In addition, current automated transcript creation software doesn't perform speaker identification, meaningful sound identification, or correct punctuation that all are necessary for accurate captioning. Work on automatically generated descriptions of video are in their infancy, and like image recognition techniques, don’t provide usable alternatives to video.</p>
                <p>Similarly, while there is well articulated guidance on how to create text transcripts or captions for audio-only media (such as radio programs and audio books), automated techniques and testing again aren’t sufficient for creating and validating these accessible alternatives.  Knowing what is important in an audio program to describe to someone who cannot hear is beyond the state of the art. There are several success criteria under this Guideline that all share these challenges of manual testing being required to ensure alternatives accurately reflect the content in the media.  These include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Audio-only and video-only (Prerecorded) (Success Criterion 1.2.1)</li>
                    <li>Captions (Prerecorded) (Success Criterion 1.2.2)</li>
                    <li>Audio description or media alternative (Prerecorded) (Success Criterion 1.2.3)</li>
                    <li>Captions (Live) (Success Criterion 1.2.4)</li>
                    <li>Audio description (Prerecorded) (Success Criterion 1.2.5)</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#info-and-relationships">Info and Relationships (Success Criterion 1.3.1)</a></h3>
                <p>Whether in print or online, the presentation of content is often structured in a manner intended to aid comprehension. Sighted users perceive structure and relationships through various visual cues. Beyond simple sentences and paragraphs, the sighted user may see headings with nested subheadings. There may be sidebars and inset boxes of related content. Tables may be used to show data relationships. Comprehending how content is organized is a critical component of understanding the content.</p>
                <p>As with media above, automated testing can determine the presence of structural markup, and can flag certain visual presentations as likely needing that structural markup. But such automated techniques remain unable to decipher if that markup usefully organizes the page content in a way that a user relying on assistive technology can examine the page systematically and readily understand its content.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#meaningful-sequence">Meaningful Sequence (Success Criterion 1.3.2)</a></h3>
                <p>Often the sequence in which content is presented affects its meaning. In some content there may be even more than one meaningful way of ordering that content. However, as with Info and Relationships above, automated techniques are unable to determine whether read aloud users will be able to read the content in a meaningful sequence ordering.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#sensory-characteristics">Sensory Characteristics (Success Criterion 1.3.3)</a></h3>
                <p>Ensuring that no instructions rely on references to sensory characteristics presents similar challenges to ensuring that color isn’t the sole indicator of meaning (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#use-of-color">Success Criterion 1.4.1</a>) – it is testing for a negative, and requires a deep understanding of meaning conveyed by the text to discern a failure programmatically.  For example, while instructions such as “select the red button” reference a sensory characteristic, “select the red button which is also the first button on the screen” may provide sufficient non-sensory context to not cause a problem (and multi-modal, multi-sensory guidance is often better for users with cognitive impairments or non-typical learning styles).</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#orientation">Orientation (Success Criterion 1.3.4)</a></h3>
                <p>While an automated test can determine that the orientation is locked, full evaluation of conformance to this criterion is tied to whether it is “<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-essential">essential</a>” for the content to be locked to one specific orientation (e.g. portrait or landscape views of an interface rendered to a cell phone).  This requires human judgement to ensure that, any time the orientation is locked, the orientation is essential to that content, to determine conformance.  This makes this criterion not fully automatable.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#identify-input-purpose">Identify Input Purpose (Success Criterion 1.3.5)</a></h3>
                <p>An automated test can easily determine that input fields use HTML markup to indicate the input purpose, it requires manual verification to determine that the correct markup was used that matches the intent for the field. For example, for a name input field, there are 10 variations of HTML name purpose attributes with different meaning and using the incorrect markup would be confusing to the user.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#use-of-color">Use of Color (Success Criterion 1.4.1)</a></h3>
                <p>This poses the same challenges as Sensory Characteristics (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#sensory-characteristics">Success Criterion 1.3.3</a>).  To discern whether a page fails this criterion programmatically requires understanding the full meaning of the related content on the page and whether any meaning conveyed by color is somehow also conveyed in another fashion (e.g. whether the meaning of the colors in a bar chart is conveyed in the body of associated text or with a striping/stippling pattern as well on the bars, or perhaps some other fashion).</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#audio-control">Audio Control[36] (Success Criterion 1.4.2)</a></h3>
                <p>An automated test tool would be able to identify media/audio content in a website, identify whether auto-play is turned on in the code, and also determine the duration.  However, an automated checking tool cannot tell whether there is a mechanism to pause or stop the audio or adjust the volume of the audio independent of the overall system volume level. This would have to be manually checked.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum">Contrast (Minimum) (Success Criterion 1.4.3)</a></h3>
                <p>Automated tools can check the color of text against the background in most cases. However, when background images are used, automated tests aren't reliably able to check for minimum contrast of text against the image&mdash;especially if the image is a photograph or drawing where the text is placed over the image. This would take human intervention to sample the text and its background to determine if the contrast meets the minimum requirement.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#resize-text">Resize Text (Success Criterion 1.4.4)</a></h3>
                <p>It takes human evaluation to discern visually if content is overlapped or missing due to a change in text size.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#images-of-text">Images of Text (Success Criterion 1.4.5)</a></h3>
                <p>This poses the same challenge as Orientation (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#orientation">Success Criterion 1.3.4</a>) - it is tied to whether it is “<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-essential">essential</a>” for text to be part of an image.  This requires human judgement, making this criterion not readily automatable. In addition, methods of employing OCR on images will not accurately discern text of different fonts that overlap each other or be able to recognize unusual characters or text that is of poor contrast with the background of the image.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#reflow">Reflow[43] (Success Criterion 1.4.10)</a></h3>
                <p>While automated tests can detect the presence of vertical and horizontal scroll bars, there are currently no reliable tests to automated validating that there has been no loss in content or functionality. Human evaluation is also still needed to determine when two-dimensional scrolling is needed for content that requires two-dimensional layout for usage or meaning.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#non-text-contrast">Non-text Contrast (Success Criterion 1.4.11)</a></h3>
                <p>This success criterion requires several levels of checks that are difficult or impossible to automate as it allows for exceptions which require human intervention to examine the intent and potentially employ exceptions to comply with the guideline. Automated checks would have to include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A way to identify UI components, which is easy for standard HTML elements, but more difficult for non-standard custom scripted components.</li>
                    <li>Whether the default user agent visual treatments for identifying UI components and states are being used (so that the exception can be utilized)</li>
                    <li>Where default treatments are not employed, a way to identify changes in state and then compare the two states for sufficient contrast. This requires human evaluation to test for differences in the portions of graphics used to show the different states or provide meaning (e.g. checked, unchecked, radio button selected, radio button unselected, toggle button selected vs. unselected and so on).</li>
                    <li>For graphical objects, a way to identify what part of the graphics are required to understand the content. Once identified, checks to determine if the presentation of the graphics is ■~@~\essential■~@~] to utilize the exception - which requires human intervention.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#text-spacing">Text Spacing[45] (Success Criterion 1.4.12)</a></h3>
                <p>This success criterion involves using a tool or method to modify text spacing and then checking to ensure no content is truncated or overlapping. This is currently no way to reliably automate this check.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Content on Hover or Focus (Success Criterion 1.4.13)</h3>
                <p>As content needs to be surafaced by providing focus on it, either with a mouse pointer or keyboard focus, to then determine whether the 3 criteria of 1.4.13 are met, this test currently requires human evaluation.</p>

                <h3><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#keyboard">Keyboard Operable[47] (Success Criterion 2.1.1)</a></h3>
                <p>Ensuring keyboard operability of all functionality currently requires a human to manually navigate through content to ensure all interactive elements are in the tab order and can be fully operated using the keyboard.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Character Key Shortcuts (Success Criterion 2.1.4)</h3>
                <p>Single key presses can be applied to content via a script but whether and what these key presses trigger can only be determined by additional human evaluation.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Timing Adjustable (Success Criterion 2.2.1)</h3>
                <p>There is currently no easy way to automate checking whether timing is adjustable. Ways of controlling differ both in naming, position and approach (including dialogs/popups before the time-out) and depends on how the server registers user interactions (e.g. for automatically extending the time-out).</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Pause, Stop, Hide (Success Criterion 2.2.2)</h3>
                <p>Typically the requirement to control moving content is provided by interactive controls placed in the vicinity of moving content, or occsionally at the beginning of content. Since position and naming vary, this assessment can not currently be automated (this involves checking that the function works as expected).</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Three Flashes or Below Threshold (Success Criterion 2.3.1)</h3>

                <h3>Bypass Blocks (Success Criterion 2.4.1)</h3>
                <p>While it can be determined that native elements or landmark roles are used, there is currently no automted way to determine whether they are used to adequately structure content (are they missing out on sections that should be included). The same assessment would be needed when other Techniques are used (structure by headings, skip links).</p>

            <section>
                <h3>Page titled (Success Criterion 2.4.2)</h3>
                <p>Automating a check for whether the page has a title is simple, ensuring that the title is meaningful and provides adaquate context is not.</p>

                <h3>Focus Order (Success Criterion 2.4.3)</h3>

            <h2>Challenge #2: Large, complex, and dynamic websites may have too many changing permutations to validate effectively</h2>
            <p>Large websites often have complex content publishing pipelines, which may render content dynamically depending upon a large number of variables (such as what is known about the logged in user and her content preferences, the geographical location that the user is visiting the site from, and the capabilities of the web rendering agent being used).  It may not be possible to validate every possible publishing permutation, each of which can have an impact on whether that particular rendering of the content at that particular moment conforms under the WCAG 2.x conformance model. </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Challenge #3: 3rd party content</h2>
            <p>Very large, highly dynamic web sites generally aggregate content provided by multiple entities. Many of these are third parties with the ability to add content directly to the website – including potentially every website visitor. While the website can provide guidance on how to post content so that it meets WCAG Guidelines and Success Criteria, it is ultimately up to those third parties to understand and correctly implement that guidance.  And as noted above, even with automated checking prior to accepting the post, many Guidelines and Success Criteria expect human validation involvement.</p>
            <p>Copyright and similar constraints that restrict the ability to modify or impose requirements on third party data can also make full page conformance impossible to assure. For instance: articles that allow reposting but without modification due to copyright restrictions.</p>

            <h2>Challenge #4: Non-Web Information and Communications Technologies </h2>
            <p>The core principles, and many of the guidelines, contained in WCAG 2.x, are broadly applicable outside of the web context.  For example, no matter the technology, information presented to humans needs to be perceivable by them in order for them to access and use it.  At the same time, some of the specific guidelines and especially some of the individual success criteria of WCAG 2.x are written specifically for web content and web technologies, and may be difficult to apply to non-web information and communications technologies (as set forth in the Working Group Note “<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2ict/">Applying WCAG to Non-Web Information and Communication Technologies</a>” or “WCAG2ICT”).  A number of entities looking to apply WCAG 2.x to non-web ICT have made use of the guidance in WCAG2ICT when drafting regulations and requirements in their contexts and countries.</p>
            <p>Some of the specific Success Criteria pose specific challenges in the WCAG2ICT context.</p>

            <h2>Challenges of Conformance as identified from Silver Research</h2>
            <p>The Silver Accessibility Guidelines project was designed to be research-based. The Silver Task Force of the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group and the Silver Community Group collaborated with researchers on questions that the Silver Group identified. This research was used to develop 11 problem statements that needed to be solved for Silver.   The detailed problem statements include the specific problem, the result of the problem, the situation and priority, and the opportunity presented by the problem.  The problem statements were organized into three main areas:  Usability, Conformance, Maintenance. The section following is taken from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/silver/draft-final-report-of-silver/#h.n2wcg0gauz5x">Conformance sections of the Silver Design Sprint Final Report</a> and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/silver/wiki/Problem_Statements#Conformance_Model">Silver Problem Statements</a>.

                    <h4>Constraints on What is Strictly Testable</h4>
                    <p><strong>Specific problem</strong>: Certain success criteria are quite clear and measurable, like color contrast. Others, far less so. The entire principle of understandable is critical for people with cognitive disabilities, yet success criteria intended to support the principle are not easy to test for or clear on how to measure. As a simple example, there is no clear, recent or consistent definition – within any locale or language – on what “lower secondary education level” means in regards to web content. Language and text content is also not the only challenge among those with cognitive and learning disabilities. Compounding this, most of the existing criteria in support of understanding are designated as AAA, which relatively few organizations attempt to conform with.</p>
                    <p><strong>Result of problem</strong>: The requirement for strict testability for WCAG success criteria presents a structural barrier to including the needs of people with disabilities whose needs are not strictly testable. Guidance that WCAG working group members would like to include cannot be included. The needs of people with disabilities – especially intellectual and cognitive disabilities – are not being met.</p>
                    <p><strong>Situation and Priority</strong>: Of the 70 new success criteria proposed by the Cognitive Accessibility Task Force to support the needs of people with cognitive and intellectual disabilities, only four to six (depending on interpretation) were added to WCAG 2.1 and only one is in level AA. The remainder are in level AAA, which is rarely implemented. There is a failure of expectations and a failure to meet user needs.</p>
                    <p><strong>Opportunity</strong>: Multiple research projects and audience feedback have concluded that simpler language is desired and needed for audiences of the guidelines. Clear but flexible criteria with considerations for a wider spectrum of disabilities helps ensure more needs are met.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h4>Human Testable</h4>
                    <p><strong>Specific problem</strong>: Regardless of proficiency, there is a significant gap in how any two human auditors will identify a success or fail of criteria. Various audiences have competing priorities when assessing the success criteria of any given digital property. Knowledge varies for accessibility standards and how people with disabilities use assistive technology tools. Ultimately, there is variance between: any 2 auditors; any 2 authors of test cases; and human bias. Some needs of people of disabilities are difficult to measure in a quantifiable way.</p>
                    <p><strong>Result of problem</strong>: Success criteria are measured by different standards and by people who often make subjective observations. Because there’s so much room for human error, an individual may believe they’ve met a specific conformance model when, in reality, that’s not the case. The ultimate impact is on an end user with a disability who cannot complete a given task, because the success criteria wasn’t properly identified, tested and understood.</p>
                    <p><strong>Situation and Priority</strong>: There isn’t a standardized approach to how the conformance model applies to success criteria at the organizational level and in specific test case scenarios.</p>
                    <p><strong>Opportunity</strong>: There’s an opportunity to make the success criteria more clear for human auditors and testers. Educating business leaders on how the varying levels of conformance apply to their organization may be useful as well. We can educate about the ways that people with disabilities use their assistive technology.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h4>Accessibility Supported</h4>
                    <p><strong>Specific problem</strong>: ‘Accessibility supported’ was never fully implemented in a way that was clear and useful to developers and testers. It also requires a harmonious relationship and persistent interoperability between content technologies and requesting technologies that must be continuously evaluated as either is updated. Further, the WG “defers the judgment of how much, how many, or which AT must support a technology to the community”. It is poorly understood, even by experts.</p>
                    <p><strong>Result of problem</strong>: Among the results are: difficulty understanding what qualifies as a content technology or an assistive technology; difficulty quantifying assistive technologies or features of user agents; claiming conformance with inadequate assistive technology; and difficulty claiming conformance.</p>
                    <p><strong>Situation and Priority</strong>: Any claim or assertion that a web page conforms to the guidelines may require an explicit statement defining which assistive technology and user agent(s) the contained technologies rely upon, and presumably inclusive of specific versions and or release dates of each. One could infer then that a conformance claim is dependant upon a software compatibility claim naming browsers and assistive technology and their respective versions. This would create a burden to author and govern such claims. Additionally, no one can predict and anticipate new technologies and their rates of adoption by people with disabilities.</p>
                    <p><strong>Opportunity</strong>: As the technologies in this equation evolve, the interoperability may be affected by any number of factors outside of the control of the author and publisher of a web page. Either “accessibility supported” should be removed from conformance requirements, or it should clearly, concisely and explicitly define and quantify the technologies or classes of technologies, AND set any resulting update or expiry criteria for governance.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h4>Evolving Technology</h4>
                    <p><strong>Specific problem</strong>: Evolving Technology: As content technology evolves, it must be re-evaluated against assistive technology for compatibility. Likewise, as assistive technology evolves or emerges, it must be evaluated against the backward compatibility of various content technology.</p>
                    <p><strong>Result of problem</strong>: There is no versioning consideration for updates to user agents and assistive technology. Strict conformance then typically has an expiry.</p>
                    <p><strong>Situation and Priority</strong>: There is no clear and universal understanding of the conformance model or its longevity. Some will infer that there is always a conformance debt when any technology changes.</p>
                    <p><strong>Opportunity</strong>: Consider conformance statements to include a explicit qualifier of time of release or versions of technology. OR consider a more general approach that is not explicit and is flexible to the differences in technologies as they evolve, identifying the feature of the assistive tech rather than the version of the assistive tech. OR consider a model that quantifies conformance as a degree of criteria met.</p>
